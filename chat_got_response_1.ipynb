       "{0: ['Honestly, at this point, I give up. I don\\'t know what to say or what to do. But I am trapped here, in this hell of my own creation. Stuck in a never ending cycle of destruction, of pain and misery. I hate the person who I have become. I hate the person I see in the mirror. I thought that every day was supposed to be a learning experience, that you end the day with more experience and knowledge than you started it with. But every day, I wake up and I feel empty. I feel empty and hollow inside. I\\'m trying to find something that gives me meaning in life, but I haven\\'t found it yet. I thought that the click of a rachet, the acrid smells of gasoline, oil, and rubber would make me whole by filling the hole in my life. But that didn\\'t last. It only numbs me from my reality, until life lops a wrench at me and shatters the window of escapism I reside in. I thought if I couldn\\'t find joy in wrenching, then I could find joy in riding. But the squeel of the tyres and the sights of the desolate road, streching out into the void of blackness far beyond what the human eye can see doesn\\'t evoke in me an emotional response anymore either. I thought that when all I could see was the slick, reflective tarmac racing past me, when all I could hear was the repeated cycle of intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust cycling at 6000 times per minute, in that moment, for however brief it would be, I thought that I could be complete. I expected catharsis, yet I only found numbness once again. I find everyone around me to be a monument to my sins, to my failures and shortcomings, to be demonstrative of the types of people I could have became, if I just applied myself enough. And that\\'s the funny thing. I wish so dearly, that I could sink into my pit of despair and depression, because in a sense, there is a certain comfort in it. But I can\\'t bring myself to admit that I\\'m a failure. I am so deathly afraid of letting others down and letting myself down. Yet, I don\\'t have the drive, the passion, the energy to do anything about my current situation. My own inaction puts me in a torturous limbo. I hate it. I hate everything and everyone around me. I feel as if I\\'d be better off dead. But I\\'m too much of a coward to act upon my convictions. Why does everyone think of me so highly? What do others see in me that I am unable to see in myself? Yo, to whoever is grading this right now, if you have even read this far, I\\'m only doing this to pass the time, and to get stuff off of my chest. I\\'ve always sucked at essay writing, and writing in general. It\\'s better not to try at this point, because you can at least coddle your pride and tell yourself that if you actually tried, you\\'d have done better. It\\'s easier to do that than to admit to yourself that you\\'re a fraud, that you don\\'t understand what you\\'re doing, or what is going on. I am incapable of growing as a person. I am trapped. I am lonely. And I know that there is no one else who can pull me out of this other than myself. But pulling myself out of this would to be acknowledging the truth and the world around me, and I don\\'t want to. I sincerly do not want to do that. The amount of emotional distress, pain, and vunerability that would cause wouldn\\'t make the catharsis of seeing myself improve be worth it. Sure the truth shall set you free, but the consequences to your actions will throw you right back into your cell again, damned for all eternity just to repeat the same cycle over. and over. and over. and over. and over. and over. and over. and over. and over again. All I do is destroy other people. I put on a veneer of a nice kid who keeps to himself. But it\\'s just that. A veneer. <br>There is no great future for me. Even when everything is going in my favor, I find a way to have it blow up in my face. I hate all of it. I never asked to be born. I never asked for all of implications of being a \"GT kid\". But yet here I am. All because people percieve a version of me that\\'s not really genuine or authentic.&nbsp;',\n",
       "  'I am not going to lie. Seeing the stupid words \"In a well-written essay, analyze how this experience of feeling out of place affects the character and contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot\" and sitting here knowing good and well that I am not going to do that one single bit makes me feel so good. These worthless tests make me sick. I am a fantastic writer, always have been, and we had to write 10s of these in class for preperation of this class. I always got 100% on all of them so it is funny to me that I am completely blowing off the only one that actually matters. I had to give my actual effort to the in class ones because they affected my grade. Think I\\'m finishing the class with a 93%-95%, somewhere around there. And here I am about to get a 1 on the AP Exam. What a wonderful and effective education system we have. Truly beautiful. A masterpiece. A real work of art. Absolutely mind blowing. Stunning! I am so ready for college to study something I actually care about and can put my effort into because I want to, not because I HAVE to. The pain of highschool schoolwork is really unmatched as it is all so useless and worthless. I\\'m going into business and property management to hopefully end up aquiring a lot of my own real estate and become a real estate investor. I have done countless hours of reasearch on the topic and watched many youtube videos about it. I am pretty confident that is what I want to do with my life. Lots of money to be made in the field as well. Youtube gets discounted as a reliable source, but there seriously some incredible stuff on there completely free of charge. I watch Ben Mallah, a very wealthy real estate investor who regularly shares tips and tricks on how to make the most money possible on real estate. He is funny and entertaining as well. I watch them for enjoyment, and quickly realized I was learning a lot as a result. I am never going to need any knowledge of poetry, how to analyze a passage, what literary devices are used in writing, or anything else that falls into the category of the complete BS we have been forced to learn throughout highschool. Makes me sick. I can pick out alliteration in a passage and know how to solve for x but guess what? I have no idea how to pay my taxes, make car payments, mortage payments, how to take out a loan, how to get good insurance, I could go on for days. The education system in the United States of American is the most ridiculous and pathetic thing I think I have ever witnessed. But guess what? I have 2 weeks left and I never have to complain about it again. Don\\'t get me wrong, highschool has been a BLAST. I have a huge group of all very close friends that I have done everything with the past 4 years. Sporting events, dances, outside activities, and more have all been absolutely amazing because I chose to surround myself with people that make laugh and make me happy. Those are the keys to life. Surrounding yourself with people you love and laughing.',\n",
       "  \"I am in a intresting perdicoment and Im not quite shore what to do so I will use this as a jurnal enrry of sourts. I work at this boyscout camo over teh summers and there is this girl who ive gotin really close with at first we were just frends then out of no where she asked me to prom but lukly I had a good exuse not to go. however I kept tellign myself that she asked me as a friend but sh kept textigng me and recently we had a staff training wejend were I got to see her and now Im caching fealings for her and I think she likes me the only problem is she is almost two years yunger than me and i don't know what to do cuz I know thats not a big gap and the grans scym of things but It dosent change the fact that at this point ib time its a little odd. not to menchin iligal. I also dont know how my parents would take it or her parents. so im thinking that we just date plitonicly and tell her that we can tell our parents when she turns 18 but she also has to try to go to the same colage as me cuz I cant do long distence for more than 2 years. and even then ot woudl stil be hard. I honestly wish I did not like her but we het along suprisingly well but I dont understand why I like her She isnt even that atractive so it kind of confuses me. ButIll figure out a solution to my problem eventuly or maby nuthing will come of it wich isint what I nesesarly wont but I think it would defenetly be the best outcome. The problem is at this point im going to hurt myself cuz I keep imajining a life together with her and That is making things worse and the only reson I like her in the furst plase is because she saud she liked me and I slowly liked her more. My Life really does just suck some times but maby thigs will get better. Another Ishue is that she keeps texting me then I respnd wich is making things worse so im going to start and shrink my responses so that mabe she will lay off wich will help me move on and realise how dumb this whole thing is. but I feel like she acnoliges the age cap cuz she brough up kinda out of poket that her parents were ten years apart and her mom was 22 and her dad was 32 wich is really bad so i feel like it cant be that bad if I end up with her and mabe I'll try but at this point in time I have no idea what to do. But I am considering just being forword and asking if she invited me to prom cuz she liked me or as a friend like that would ot everything to bed but we got to be alone for that to happen. I feel bad for whomever has to read this tho its probubly sumwhat entertaining. But also really uncomfterbull I would hate reading somone elses lifes problems but her I am forcing somone to read my problems. Though depending on when thsi is graded I will have solved this problem as my i will be working with her for june and july at a bsa camp where we will have a little to much alone time.&nbsp;\",\n",
       "  \"Today is May 4, 2022, and that means that prom is exactly three days away. I am so excited to go to prom this year with my friends because it is our senior year and we are going to have the most fun we've ever had. It is going to be an exciting chain of events for us. That day is also my mom's birthday, which will make the day just that much more exciting. The most exciting part of prom is probably the getting ready aspect of it. The excitement that you feel in the pit of your stomach as you're applying your makeup and curling your har. It is just so riveting to see yourself all dressed up for an event that you've literally been waiting all year for. Then, going out to dinner before with your group and taking pictures in your amazing outfits is always a treat. After you eat the drive to the prom is always so much fun because you blast the music and have a little burst of energy before you get into a room full of hundereds of people dancing and screaming and just overall going wild. It is so fun to see everyone getting out of their comfort zones for one night to dance and have fun with each other. This year I am most excited because of my prom group. My best friends, Kasish, Caroline and I invited one of our school friends, Ruben to come to prom with us. Everyone is talkign about how he is either going to look like a player going to prom with three girls or he'll look like a loser just sitting in the corner holding our bags. I think we can make him look good. I'm also excited just to get ready because my dress this year is literally the most stunning thing I have ever seen. It is black, my favorite color, and ever since I've lost the weight I tried so hard to get rid of, my body looks increddible in that freaking dress. It is just so amazing and I can't wait to wear it. I think it's going to be a show stopper for sure. This year is just going to me magical. I can feel it in my bones.&nbsp;\",\n",
       "  'Literary elements stalk us in our daily routines, with that being said i believe that traditional schooling is ridiculous, and that a new system of education must be adopted in the near future in order to maintain our current society we live in. The idea of going to a building and sitting down to learn a specific thing was something adopted in the industrial revolution to get more factory workers, that idea of education has seeped into our schools and colleges. Let\\'s not even start about the prices of higher education nowadays. I mean, 30k a year to go to school? That\\'s insane. That\\'s almost what the average american makes in a single year, all going towards \"bettering yourself.\" All just to get a peice of paper that says you\\'re qualified for a job, when you learn the majority of your skills in the job itself rather than in the classroom environment. Then, unless daddy pays for this very expensive peice of paper, you\\'ll be paying off student loans until youre 40 years old, meaning you spent the last 20 years or so learning, paying off, and stressing over something that just gives you the ability to get your feet wet.

It all started when like my friend grou merged with his friend group cause my friend was also dating his friend. It started with us all partying together. We would drink of course. So Johnny does this thing where he would like come up to me and just flirt, were both drunk of course. Idk if his behavior is just bro behavior or is he really just curious?

       "  'I feel like when a character feels out of place is when they think they arent someone they feel like are at times like themselves and they tend to be feeling like they dont like themselves like self-love and that can be hard to some people because they think that people dont care about them or they feel like an outsider like they want to be someone they arent supposed to be at all and its very diffcult to see that because they be comparing to other people like for example that they cant do something that the other person can do they dont push themselves to do better they always be negative about how they cant see that they can accomplish big things that the other people can too. its really hard to see people struggle with that because they always tend to have questions to how they cant become better. Or sometimes people are out of place when they are having a conversations with someone and they went out of line like out of place to be saying things. People be too self centered about things that they dont realize that they are effecting the other people around them too with that negative energy it wont take it anywhere but hatred about themselves.&nbsp;',\n",

       " 1: ['&nbsp;In <em>The Great Gatsby </em>by F . Scott Fitzgerald Nick the recently new home owner next to Gatsby feels out of place when invited to the party as he is the only one with the invitation everyone else comes uninvited and when Gatsby and Daisy meet for the first time all over again Nick had no clue what to do or where to go since Gatsby said he needed him their with him for support. The entire book Nick is just an oddly placed character to follow the adventures of the love story and share with the readers what is happening. During the first week of Nick living next to Gatsby he sees this big house party but wonders what was happening and then it continues every week and they would only get larger and larger still Nick being confused he still has yet to gotten to meet him as he has not seen him around the area only once and it was just a figure that shortly dissapeared in the night. Once Gatsby has invited Nick to the party Nick has just figured out that he is the only one with an invotation and is thinking about leaving since he feels out of place in the enviroment but he decided to stay and have a couple drinks. The couple drinks turned into a lot of drinks and he is now feeling like he is the life of the party as he is dancing around he continues his search for Gatsby. He finds a \"helper\" at the party and starts talking down on Gatsby and saying a lot of bad things about him that he has heard as rumors and it is a suprising shock to Nick when he finds out that the man he was talking to was The Great Gatsby and that was their first time introduction. Gatsby is a kind and forgiving man who does not hold grudges towards people so he easily forgave him for the hurtful comments. Secondly , Daisy who is Nicks cousin is found out to be Gatsby\\'s long time lover that he has not seen in years. Nick tries to reunite them together for the sanity of Gatsby. Gatsby has known where she lived and build a house directly acrossed the water from her and has waited for her to come to one of the parties that he hosts since that is what the parties are for they are for her so they can reunite. So Nick has invited Daisy over to his house without her knowing that Gatsby is also at Nicks house waiting for Daisy to arive. Once Daisy arives it is very silent and Nick is trying to leave to let them talk alone but Gatsby pulls him back in the house asking him to stay since he can not do it alone. The entire time they are talking Nick just standing in the courner waiting for them to need him or say somthing to him. The character of Nick plays a crutial role in the story but also does not speak bearly at all unless he is drunk or asked questions he is just used as a Telephone to hear what they have said and to provide use with what they have said. This happens throughout the book as in car rides, when Tom takes Nick out to get drinks on his birthday, when they made Daisy pick which lover she wanted. The only time he was viewed as included was when Gatsby died and no one would help with the funeral planing or payments . Nick tried to do everything that he could do since he knows that their was really no one else that knew Gatsby like Nick did. Nick did not share his feels of exclusion but it was shown in parts, we all know Nick loved Gatsby and he provided so much to him and did what ever they could for eachother but when Gatsby was with Daisy it was if Nick did not exist around her. During the heat wave when everyone was in the room together including Nick , Gatsby brought up the face that Daisy never loved Tom at this point Nick once again tries to leave since he felt uncomfterable but he was not able to they would not let him leave. They continue to go into this huge fight and Nick is just in the corrner lissening to the argument as it happens. Once they finish arguing Gatsby takes Daisy and leaves Nick their with Tom , Tom sees Nick after the fight and offers to drink Nick says yes since he remembered it is his birthday.

       "  'Well usually when someone feels out of place it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s their fault. It just means that they are with the wrong people. We live in a society where we blame ourselves for not being like other people and for not doing the things that they do but in reality we just have to be ourselves and find the right people who won\\'t make you feel out of place. I\\'ll give myself as an example. I am a 18 year old male who is a senior in high school who doesn\\'t drink, doesn\\'t party or go to parties, someone who doesn\\'t want to go to prom and someone who doesn\\'t want to even go to graduation, and to top it all off i am loyal to my God because I am critstian. But we live in a society where people below my age think that vaping, drinking, smoking, partying is normal and it \"living life\" but that isn\\'t living life or well for me it isn\\'t because I am not like them. So going to school for 180 days of feeling left out sucks because i come to school and i can\\'t relate to anyone because they all drink and like to party etc etc. We also have people thinking that there are more than two gender and who think abortion is okay and i just don\\'t agree and i don\\'t like to link myself up with those type of people. So with time i\\'ve come to conlcude that i am different and i need to be with people who are like me. I\\'m not gonna cry over someones opinion because they don\\'t like me. i could care less if anyone likes me I just want to be with the right people who i know will be my friend and be by my side. I\\'m not saying society is the problem, all i\\'m saying is that I just don\\'t fit in and i\\'m not the problem and nore should i change who i am but i just need to be with the right people and thats okay. I know we are all different and i know not everyone has my mature mindset but if not shared or expressed then being in the wrong crowd can really change and hurt people. Parent don\\'t take the time to teach tehre kids to be thereselves anymore, becaus now being gay is cool or vaping is cool or dirnking is cool and just for the feeling of being includede people change who they are to fit in because before they didn\\'t. So anyway now that, that is over let me tell ya my plans so basically after i leave this boring school I get to to go home early maybe and i don\\'t know yet if i\\'m going to make pasta with grinded meat because i realllyyyyy want some but i also have chinese food that i did not finish, now that i think about it, i don\\'t really like chinese food like that anymore, maybe a wantan soup and definitely the dumplings because those are fireeee but yeah ia lso don\\'t have much time to cook if i was to make pasta with grinded meat because I have a soccer game to watch and well my dad is supposde to watch it but who knows ya know? but if he is going to pick me up then I won\\'t make any food and him and I will most likely buy something to eat and watch the glorious semi final againts manchester city, i really hope they win. Tomorrow is another busy day for me because i gotta study my character for a criminal justice project and then after that i also got some music i gotta learn for teen arts and then i have band and jazz band rehearsal afterwards at 3pm at school so i gotta go home and change and come back, then i gotta go to church and then i get to finally watch doctor strange in the Multiverse of madness which I have been waiting so long to do so i can\\'t wait but it is as busy day so wish me luck in the success for tomorrow and also that real madrid win today, peace out have a great day.',\n",

To keep everyone equal, the everyone but the reciver are also deprived of the ability to see color as to not see race. We are told that the pervious girl who was given this honor ran away past the bounds of the city because she was unable to cope with the trama which relased the memories she had into society causing a great deal of pain to the people. The boy has many questions but starts the process of reciving the memories well.

Unable to let this happen, he is develops a plan to accelerate the pace at which he is keeping track of the memories and run away with Gabriel to release all the memories to the population in hopes that they realise that he did the right thing. The author of the book is also trying to teach the readers a lesson that Authoritarion Societys do not work and that it is dangerous to heavily censor information. People should mostly be free to make their own desions and decide right from wrong. The abscence of accountibilty has and will create dangerous situatons where people will die.&nbsp;',\n",
       "  'In \"Fahrenheit 451\" by Ray Bradbury, as he realizes how wrong the world has become because of their mass censorship, Guy Montag goes against society in order to preserve books and knowledge. Montag\\'s role in society at the beginning of the book was a fireman who burned houses that illegally kept books. When Montag saw the woman whose house he was supposed to burn for keeping books burn herself alive along with her books, that was the catalyst for him to wonder what was so precious about books that someone would willingly burn themselves with it. He questioned his job as a fireman, and questioned if what he was doing was right or wrong. His curiosity led him to do something a fireman in this novel should never do- keep a book and read it. Even though he didn\\'t quite understand what the words between the pages meant at first, he knew they meant something important which is why he continued to read them, and continued to try sharing it with others. He read to his wife, Mildred, and her friends, but they did not seem to understand it either, or if they did, they started crying. Although Mildred claimed that because her friend was crying from the reading that it was inappropriate, Montag knew that she understand those words, and those words had formed into a piece of art, and that art can be emotional. To Montag, his reading aloud was a success, even if Mildred\\'s friends never came back. He understood that he couldn\\'t change society as a whole overnight, but he did do smaller things like burning the chief of the fire department, hiding books in other firemen\\'s houses, have someone print copies of books to distribute to the world, and even considered burning down the fire department itself. He even memorized a book before having it get burned, and ran off to share his newfound knowledge with others and to pass it to the next generation. He wanted the world that killed others for joy and only cared about having fun to realize that there are so much more things to appreciate like dandelions, grass blades, rain, and of course, the act of knowing, and Montag believed that the key to knowing was inside books.&nbsp;',\n",

When missionaries come to his home and try to inform him on this religion that is attempting to be spread he takes interest in hearing about what is wanting to be said. Constant violence in all forms was the the only time his father would interact with him, besides when he would pretend he had found an interest in fighting just to have a conversation where his dad showed him anything but violence. When seeking information about the word of Christ he was treated kindly and not forced into having to convert religions or pretend to be something he was not to be treated kindly. They wanted him to convert on his own and know that they would understand his decision. This ultimately captures his attention because of this reference to a Father full of love and not telling him there is only one correct way to be a man. His father however was not pleased at all and ultimately disowned him for not following his dad the way he wanted. With this new religion spread Ikumifuna took it upon himself to spread this to his mother and others around their home and help the missionaries in spreading the word of Christ. More and more people started to become interested in this new religion that Ikumifuna's dad felt that he no longer had control over his village and saw suicide as the best way to deal with this. Ikumifuna was happy at the thought of all of his fathers wives and children finally becoming free from his abusive behavior. He planned to live his life how he wanted and not under the influence of his dad any longer under the help of this new religion being spread to his village.

       "  'When a character feels out of place, they lose the ability to blend in well. Their perception becomes warped too, either in bad or good ways. It could also develope communication problems by not having common interests with other people. Interactions could become much more awkward through corrupted perception too, with the protagonist not understanding or interpreting words/interactions as hostile. The protagonist could provide insight into their thinking process and highlight flaws. There is an understanding between the reader and protagonist, whether or not there is some exhageration between interactions. The feeling of being out of place is also not a great feeling, the protagonist could create their own downfall just because they feel uncomfortable, to some this will sound unreasonable but it is also based on some truth. When someone does not feel comfortable they will literally sacrafice their own future just to not make someone else feel similar, their perception is scewed this way. Their reality is much more different compared to anothers, this comparison could be exploited using another character that is much more outgoing, creating tension between the two or learning more of the more shy character. When a character is out of touch, it could also be because of past trauma, another way to create an understanding with the reader and said character. When a character is feeling out of place, they can create conflict with other characters as well, creating a plot by just wanting to either communicate, silence themselves, or resolve a problem they create. A character like this could help with story, but not always can they recieve sympathy.'],\n",

In fact, it has become the normal thing for some people. In <em>Firefly Lane, </em>Tallulah Hart feels very out of place. She lives with her mother who is high all the time and pays no attention to her. She feels out of place becasue her best friend Kate seems so have the perfect family and the perfect life. Tully feeling out of place results in her making decicions that are questionable. She lies to her best friend, she goes to parties when she is underage, and she gets involved with the wrong person when she is in college.

She is embarassed of her mother, so she lies to Kate and tells her that she has cancer. This decsiion contributes to the interpertation as a whole because it helps the audience to relate to the characters in the book. Everyone has lied at some point in their life, and felt the guilt of it. They have also been lied to before, and undertand how that feels.The author is able to keep the reader engaged by showing how Tallulah navigates the lie that she has told. She makes the decision to lie becasue she feels out of place in her friendship with Kate.                                               <br>Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Another questionable decision that Tallulah makes becasue she feels out of place is that she goes to parties when she is in high school. She does this becasue she just wants to be normal and do what everyone else is doing. She knows that it is the wrong decsion, but she can\\'t help herself. This decision contributes to the interpretation as a whole because it shows how hurt Tallulah really is. She is so hurt and feels so out of place that she makes some decisions that she knows are wrong. She does this just so she can be \"normal\" like everyone else.                                 Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Tully also gets involved with the wrong person becasue she feels so out of place. When she is in college, she gets involved with her professor, which proves to be a really bad decision. Even in college she is not been able to shake the feeling of being out of place.She doesn\\'t care about following any rules becasue she feels so out of place. She is so mad at the world that she will do anything to feel something. This decsion contributes to the interpretation as a whole becasue it allows the audiece to see that she will do anything to get what she wants. All she wants is to be satisfied becasue she rarely every gets that feeling. She feels out of place everywhere she goes, and just wants to feel like she belongs somewhere.    <br>Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0In conclusion, Tallulah makes questionable decisions that are a result of her feeling out of place. She lies to her best friend, goes parties in high school, and gets involvd with one of her college professors. Tallulah will do anything to get what she wants, even if it is not the right thing or the best thing to do. The reasoning behind her actions is that she just wanted to feel like she was welcomed and belonged where she was.

       "  \"Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0In the novel series <ins>Percy Jackson</ins>, written by Rick Riordian, many of the main characters experience a feeling of being out of place. The premise of the novel series is that the main characters are demigods, or the children of dieties (In the case of the novel, either Greek or Roman dieties). Because these children have a parent that is quite literally a god, during the normal times of their life they often feel out of place within normal society. In the first novel, <ins>Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</ins>, it is explained that one of the many reasons that these characters feel out of place is because their brains are wired to function differently from regular humans. Nico is a character that has felt out of place his whole life. Being the son of Hades, god of death and of the underworld, Nico has certain powers that initially left him unable to function within normal society. This concept that Nico is unable to fit into normal society not only affects the character, but also has an influence on the interpretation of the Percy Jackson series as a whole. <br>Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Nico, unable to fit into society had spent his whole life running. When he eventually ran into the safe haven for demigods like him, he still was out of place. He could not control the powers that hurt those around him. Even in a setting in which he was supposed to feel at home, Nico could not do to the power that was out of his control. This left Nico to feel isolated from the people who were supposed to be his friends, as he couldn't relate to them. Unlike most of the children demigods, Nico had not been raised like a normal human. Nico spent his life running away. Not only could Nico not relate to the other demigods because he lacked life experiences similar to them, he was also isolated due to the fact that he couldn't necessarily be around them given his power could potential harm then unintentially. Nico was the lone wolf, and as a result remained isolated and generally would always feel out of place as a result.<br>Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0In the midst of the Percy Jackson series, Nico is representative of the damages isolation and egocentrism can cause. The general centralized theme established throughout the Percy Jackson series was that teamwork can make even impossible things possible and that friendship can help one reach their potential; and Nico represents the challenges that can come across and compromise a goal. Nico's personality and actions all ultimately boil down to the core concept that isolationism can inhibit goals and having a negative mindset (such as constantly believing one is out of place) can lead to these detrimental factors in inhibiting one's potential. <br>Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0All in all, Nico, one of the main characters in the Percy Jackson series, is the outlier within the group of main characters. He constantly feels out of place, metaphorically representing isolationism and its impact, and as a result contributes towards the work by demonstrating the negative impacts that isolationism can have on achieving goals.\",\n",

He also relize that as he got older his brain would work differenlty and he could do things that he would never imagine he would be able to do. One day, he goes to the zoo and realizes that he can talk to snakes because he can understand what the snake is saying to him and they start to have a conversation in a way that his uncle realizes that he is taking to a snake and looks at him like hes a freak and even calls him a freak. Harry than discovers that the reason why he feels out of place so much and can never fit in with normal human kids is because he isn\\'t a normal human kid, Harrry is a wizard. Harry being a wizard makes him realize why he has always felt like he doesnt belong and is out of place. He also connects the reason why his aunt and uncle didnt like him because they new that he was a wizard by blood because his two parent were wizards before he died. He felt so out of place because he wasnt human but a wizard with a mind of a wizard who could talk to snakes. In a way, when Harry find this out we can see throught the story how to characters life and emtions change. He is sent of to a school who is meant for wizard kids like him to study and express the wizard jeans and blood without being judeged by other humans and being called \"freaks\". Harry meets his best friend when he goes to Hogwarts which are called  Harmony granger and Ron wiseley. They teach Harry the value of love and friendship and for the first time in his life, Harry felt at home and in place. Harry found the place were he wouldnt be judged because he was different but he could express his true self. We see Harry as he grows up through out the books on how he changed as a human being and starts to feel more welcomed in life and is finally feel included and not mistreat like his aunt and uncle would mistreat him. Harry feeling out of place gave him a sense of hopelessness and feeling unworthy of being able to do nothing with his life because all his life all his aunt and uncle would tell him was that he was nothing and didnt belong in there family. We see the charcter grow from that and the transformation from not feeling like he belongs and is in the right place to feeling belonged and finally having that feeling that he is home and belongs and is worthy of something in life.&nbsp;',\n",

In the book \"Pride and Prejudice,\" Jane Austin plants a hopeless romantic, Elizabeth Bennett, into a society that values marrying for title, status, and wealth. Elizabeth witnesses those around her crave these aspects of life in hopes of supporting themselves and their families. Elizabeth tries to avoid this scene yet is dragged in by her sister Jane whom hopes to win over a wealthy man.Thankfully, Elizabeth is soon able to find true love with a man named Mr. Darcy and winds up creating her own life. Mr. Darcy is very wealthy yet Elizabeth\\'s intrest spouts from her love for him and nothing else. Thus, Elibeth was able to create her own unique future as she let her differences guide her and didn\\'t conform to those around. Overall, those who feel out of place may create their own destiny and future as they are lead by their unique nature.                                       <br>                   Oftentimes, when one strays from the intended path of life, they may distrupt societal standards and influence those around them. For many it is hard to accept the sucess of others when it comes in an unconventional way; however, others may take it as inspriation. Thus, a divide may be created between what society deems to be acceptable and a disruption of societal standards is formed. In \"Pride and Prejudice,\" Elizabeth\\'s unconventional way of winning over Mr. Darcy was frowned upon by many. Although she was the one with pure intentions, it was foreign for somebody to not crave titles, status, and wealth. Thus, Elizabeth\\'s success in gainging this by meerly being herself created envy. Envy and resentment was one opinion towrds her love; however, acceptance was another. Some people, espescially those close to Elizabeth, looked at her to be an inspiration. She proved the love is enough and it should be prioritized above greed. She created a divide in society and disrupted societal standards because of the feeling that she was out of place.

These conflicts can range from the main character fighting against themselves, their friends and family, society, the opposite gender, etc. In The Bell Jar, the main character's hardest conflict is the battle she faces within herself. Despite having a good internship, good grades, and a supportive family, she still feels out of place. She continues to feel worse, and feels confusion, but accepts the downfall.  This then leads into a long spiral of depression and derealization of her own life. She does not reach out for help when she begins to feel out of place in the world. She isolates herself and stops taking care of herself or anything having to do with her life's achievements. She is essentially, consumed by her feelings of doubt in herself. She gives up hope. Her experiences go to show how much of a toll it cake take on an individual when their inner self feels like they do not belong. After she stops believing in her own capabilites, she moves home and stays with her mother. She finds living dreadful, and it is further exemplified when she moves back home. She harbors feelings of infeririority and lack of interest in her life. She simply wishes to be gone. After a suicide attempt, she is admitted to a psych ward. Her experiences in the psych ward definitely helped her out of her spiral. She met people that made her feel less crazy, but her egotistical and depressive outlooks on life stopped her from developing any actual human relationships, whether romantic or not. She feels that her own sadness is above that of anybody else. However, when one of her acquaintances takes her own life, a major life motion is set into place. We never fully know the outcome of the main character's life, whether or not she is successfully recovered and out of the hospital. However, we know she is left feeling optimistic about life, which she lacked beforehand. Many people relate to content in the Bell Jar because it is very closely related to the life of its' author, Sylvia Plath, who took her own life after a long battle with mental illness. The story of the Bell Jar is interpreted as a feminist novel that touches on the matter of mental health, and the lengths we can go to as humans when we simply do not feel like our place in the world is secure.&nbsp;\",\n",

With intent of being a hero, handsome, strong, and manly, Frankestein gathers organs and limbs of dead people from graves and creates a human in his science lab. What he intended however, was not reality. Them monster he created had black teeth, ugly, horrifying to the eyes, and violent. Horrified, Frankestein left the monster in his lab and continued to have a life of his own. However, later in the novel we are shown the monsters true feelings and experieces. The monster conveys to his creator, Victor Frankestein, that he feels negelected and that is why he is wrecking havoc. The monster continues to say that humans look at him weird and no one will take him in, so he resorts to violence instead. The monster even threatens Victors family and does eventually kill many of his family members. This neglect brought upon by Victor, affects the monster in regards to violence, but also in regards to the fact that because of this, the monster truly has no idea how to act around people and doesn\\'t know right from wrong. For example when the monster was observing the family to learn things from them, he eventually lit their house on fire. This is not necessarily because the monster hated the family, it was just cause he was not taught what is right and what is wrong. He felt ignored and socially rejected when everyone got scared looking at him and his own owner dissapears in horror. This is why the monster resorts to violence and blackmail. The monster ends up killing William, Victors brother, after Vicotr disappears from Victors life. The monster then leaves hints in sneaky ways that it was him who killed Victors brother and then vows to be with Victor during his wedding day. All of this social rejection and neglect gave the monster his name. In contrast, we would have seen a compleely different story if Victor stuck with his creation and taught him what is right and wrong. This lack of neglect would make the monster feel cared for and shy him away from violence.&nbsp;',\n",

First, Nick meets with his cousin, Daisy who introduces him to her husband, Tom, a rich and hard-headed man. Evidently, he cheats on her with a woman who makes him buy her new sets of clothes to wear almost every day to appear luxurious, despite not being well-off herself. These dysfunctional relationships and the clothes establish the facade that these people depict themselves as, Tom as a loyal husband, and his mistress as rich. Nick, not being very well-off himself, does not associate himself with them very closely. Throughout the story we are shown various signs of a \"higher power\". This is through a billboard with the specifically blue eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleberg which watch over the city. These reoccur as a symbol throughout the story to express how everyone is being scrutinized, whether it be by a theroetical higher power or in skepticism of each other. Nick never accustoms himself with the people of West Egg and finds himself a part of these watching eyes. At the climax of the story, Gatsby is murdered at his home after a misunderstanding with Tom as Gatsby tried to start an affair with his wife, Daisy. He\\'s found dead in his pool, ironically despite always saying that he was afraid of swimming.

       "  'In the story <em>The scarlet Letter</em>, which takes place a couple hundred years ago in the New World, a woman has an affair with a priest while her husband is away overseas. She ends up pregnant and is labeled with a scarlet colored \"A\", standing for adulter, on all of her clothes in order to make her stick out in a crowd and publically shame her. Being branded with such a label was meant to bring sadness and guilt to the wearer and mock her for the mistakes she has made in her past. During most of the story, the woman battles with feelings of being an outcast, all while trying to provide her new daughter with the best life she can muster. The woman\\'s mental stability is affected trumendously, but she works hard to break out of her insecurity and leave an impactful mark on her daughter.

She marched around the small town and paraded her beautiful daughter to the people. Though she faced backlash, she wanted her daughter to understand that being herself is okay, and differences don\\'t make someone a bad person. The story follows this theme and uses this plot, as well as the gold embroidered letter, to drive the idea home that standing out isn\\'t a sin, and that readers should treat themselves and others with respect, even if they disagree with others ideas and actions. This theme makes the story inspiring and relatable to most, since everyone has felt like an outcast at some point in life. <em>The Scarlet letter</em> and the gold embroidered \"A\" emphasises the importance of accepting your own identity before attempting to persuade others to agree with yours.'],\n",
       " 3: ['Many works of literature examine the experience of characters who feel out of place, whether that is within their family, their community, their culture, or their own body. In the novel, \"<em>The Great Gatsby</em>,\" the protagonist Nick Carraway, experiences this feeling when he gets an insight on the lives of the elite and rich people around him, causing him to flee and never want to be associated with those people ever again. In the beginning of the novel, Nick was a very humble man who never judged people. He was not the richest but was quite well-off for the time period. He had just recently moved to the West Egg of town and comes across his neighbor, Gatsby, a man known for fitting into the stereotypes of the rich people during that time. Always partying and drinking. Already, Nick does not feel too secure, since he lives in a very tiny house near all of these huge mansions. But he decides to put that aside and becomes close with his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom. Eventually, Gatsby is aware of Daisy and Nick being related, so he makes it a mission to befriend him to get close to Daisy, who is an ex-lover of his. Nick and Gatsby spend a lot of time together and considers him to be a friend of his. Nick gives him advice on his obsession with Daisy and tell him, \"You can\\'t bring back the past.\" Gatsby dismisses Nick, making him feel as if he has no voice because of his economic and social status. Gatsby is of new-money, so he doesnt really have a lot of respect when it comes to his status either. Daisy and Tom are of old money, which is the sole reason why Daisy didn\\'t end up Gatsby instead. It was a forbidden love. Nick tries to get them together to see his friend happy, but it does not work out because Daisy cares too much about her reputation as an old-money woman. This the breaking point for Nick, because he starts to judge them. Another reason why he felt out of place. He was starting to go against his morals and values. Ever since he was a child, his father taught him to never judge people because you never know what they\\'re going through in their lives and Nick stood by that. But the people around him are what he hated most about people. They were selfish and did not really care about anyone or anything but their money and status. Towards the end of the novel, Tom, Daisy, and Gatsby have a quarrel over Daisy and Gatsby\\'s affair. Tom exposes the way Gatbsy attained his new wealth and makes Daisy realize that being with a man like him will ruin her reputation. Nick, what seems to be like the irrelevant character of it all, just watches the relationship of everyone unravel before his eyes. Gatbsy end up being shot by the husband of Tom\\'s mistress, believing that Gatsby was the one who ran her over, even though it was Daisy. Gatsby took the blame to protect the woman he loves most believing that, in return, she will leave Tom for him. Nick devastated for his friend had gave him some more advice to flee the country and admittted that Daisy is no good for him. Stubborn as he was Gatbsy decided to wait for Daisy to contat him, making Nick lose a friend of his over his cousin, who did not even have the courage to attend the funeral. Nick calls her multiple times to ler her know what has happened and she flee\\'s the country with Tom. Nick, disgusted and astonished, cannot believe that a person like her can just cover up her murder. At the very end of the novel, Nick states that he will be leaving the West Egg to another side of New York. In summary, although Nick was not involved with all the drama going on in his life, he still got the chance to view all of it with the point of view as a non-rich person.The author chose Nick to be the narrator of the book because he is the most un-biased and is the only one who can give the readers the most accurate information when it came to the lives of the people around him. Nick did not are about his economic or social status to want to protect it as much as someone like Gatsby or Daisy. The readers had a better insight into the dramatic lives of the elite at the time and had comprehension of how powerful money can be.&nbsp;',\n",
       "  \"Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Many works of literature feature a character that feels out of place or as if they do not fit in. One piece of literature that features this is The Death of a Salesman. Although many works of fiction feature a character that feels out of place, Death of a Salesman features Biff, who feels as if he is a failure and cannot make his father proud, therefore he feels out of place within not only the world, but his family as well. Biff talks about his varius jobs and how he has tried to do such a wide variety of things but never succeeds as they do not always work out for him. This aspect of Biff's life gets him discouraged and feeling down and then his brother, Happy, who is a somewhat successful salesman, atleast more successful than Biff, also puts pressure on Biff to become successful because he does not want to be the brother in the family who does not amount to anything and lets his family down. This pressure from his brother in addition to the stress of his career not going anywhere, causes Biff to feel out of place in his family as he dreads feeling as if he is a disappointment. Biff continues to feel this way despite certan hiccups within his family, such as his father, Willy, growing old and suffering certain mental disorders. The fact that this feeling of not belonging takes over Biff while Biff is also dealing with other feelings towards his family shows just how significant it is for an individul to feel out of place. To feel out of place anywhere in life, especially in your own family, is something that can hold a strong influence on someones perspective of life and overall approach to life itself. We can see this in Death of a Salesman as Biff is going of to bars and increasingl shows signs of indifference towards his life and all of the things in it. Biff begins to dread the mundaneness of his life but loses the ambition to do anything to change thator chase anything new in his life. This detrimental loss of ambition can also be an effect of Biff simply feeling out of place in his family. Towards the end of Death of a Salesman, Biff unleashes his anger on his father for an event that he experienced in his childhood and in Biff's climax of emotions, he reveals that he is tired of his family pretending all the time and acting as if everything is perfect even when it is not. This resentment towards fakeness that Biff shares could be a significant reason as to why he would feel out of place in his family. This difference between Biff and his family could be an aspect to embrace as they could use it to teach other and learn of their differing perspectives on life and opposing coping mechanisms when dealing with situation that do not go as planned. However, the unfortune turn of events ends with a more negative and morbid note rather than a positive solution. This unfavorable conclusion influences the interpretation of the novel by expressing the message of a negative connotation towards differences in the family. The authors underlying tone of the story sets up the readers to subconconciously adopt a negative view on feeling out of place, when really it could be seen as something to learn fromand embrace. The experience of feeling out of place in which Biff undergoes, causes his entire perspective of his life as well as his family to be tainted with negativity. The way in which the author illistrates this to the reader can create an underlying interpretation that people who feel out of place can struggle to find happiness and positivity. This message is important to readers because it can teach them the significance behind inclusivity and how much of a difference you as an individual can have in another indiviudals life, whether that be positive or negative.\",\n",
       "  \"William Shakespeare's <em>Hamlet</em> is a culmination of many plotlines, though as a whole, it showcases the main character(Hamlet) feeling out of place in many circumstances, contributing to any and all interpretations of the work. Though it is true that the story is of the classic revenge archetype, that alone characterizing it as canonically 'out of place', the main character in his interpersonal and internal relationships are what make it a complex story to read and understand. Beginning with the more complicated concept of internal dialogue and relationship with oneself, Prince Hamlet of Denmark shows in his many soliloquies and monologues that he finds turmoil in himself. While it could be argued that a cry for help to oneself about his failures as an actor, a ramble to which it is unclear if is spoken to the audience or to himself as a justification and self-therapizing, is not a <em>true</em> definition of feeling out of place, it is also easy to argue that it is. Mere moments after what most readers would define as a positive interaction between the prince and the acting troupe, Hamlet goes on to 'vent' and attempt to release his own tension in the safety of his lonesome, before the text goes violent in dialogue. The character, in most adaptations, begins to shout, and even make a scene, even though other character is present until after he has spoken fully. In the external world, this would not be considered stability, so why even for fiction should we deem it as such? The feeling of crawling in one's skin, even emotionally, can be seen in many actions, and as it is seen nearing the middle to end of the play, interrupting a play that has been already altered, once more to monologue and interrupt the world created for him, is not the most 'sane' option. Another simple example tied into this, was the lack of morality and seemingly filter, as Hamlet continually disrespected his former lover(in social or romantic light(Ophelia)), in public before the play had begun. This then transitions into the following example, which is the <em>interpersonal</em> interactions Hamlet has. Simply put: Hamlet's father was murdered by a man who not only lives, but has begun to control the prince in every aspect. From putting Ophelia up to the task of eavesdropped conversations, to ruling the kingdom that [logically] Hamlet should inherit, Claudius has placed the prince into a position outside the life he has control over. This plot, while demonstrating the distance between Hamlet and a life of his choosing, also shows to readers a psychological understanding from between the lines that may not have been understood if it were as plain as it could have been. Shakespeare, while having been a writer of much fame, also wrote in length his plays, consisting in this one of 5 acts. This extension to the average modern play(1-2 acts), gives viewers and readers time to process the corruption in both the hierarchy displayed, and the characters shown. Many viewers would understand from first glance, that from the complexity of each characters' interactions with Prince Hamlet, and his speeches to himself, he <em>is</em> outcasted. Social shunning and the death of his father created madness, to which only grew as he learned that each of his loved ones had betrayed him, leaving him more and more alone. While it is an unfair fate, it is also a fate that even only socially, modern audiences can relate to. Trials and Tribulations exist everywhere, and can create a depth that as seen in Hamlet, can affect both a character and any and all interpretations and replecations of the original work.\",\n",

The feeling of out of place Winston feels is the driving point of the hole story, from when he first decides to write in the journal to the moment in the chesnut coffee shop hearing that oceania has won the war. A feeling of being out of place can drive people to do things they would have never done without.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0at the beginning of the book we meet Winston a seemingly average man who is later in his life. He lives in a world were everything is controlled by the \"party\" by Big Brother even your own thoughts are monitored and controlled by them. Winston was not very keen with this he hated the party he hated Big Brother, so he got a journal to write his thoughts down. Ealier in the day the situation that motivated him to comit such a act of \"thought crime\" was a mere glimpse a mutial respect between someone he thought was trust worthy. This feeling of out of place Winston felt started to effect his action in his day to day process of life more and more, he started writing in his journal subconsiously \"DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\" over and over. This contributes to the main thesis statement because if Winston never had that feeling of being out of place and fit right on in with the status quo the party wants. Winston being out of place pushes him even further beyond just writing in a journal he has sexual intercourse with a woman other then his wife, Julia another person who just like Winston feels out of place. Together they rent a room above Mr. Charrington\\'s shop and meet there on several occasions to have sex and to discuss the working of the party. If neither of them ever felt such ways not a single event in this story would occur, there would be no book. The whole agenda of the party is to have control over the very thoughts of the people they destroy literature, news paper articles, photos, even dictionaries of word they dont want to be apart of the official vocabulary. The party doesnt want anyone to feel out of place and they squish that feeling as soon as it starts to fester something big, to leave the \"thought criminals\" even more defeated then they were.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0George Orwell wrote what could be considered a cautionary story, a story of a time and place that society could very well end up. feeling out of place from a society standpoint has never been good and it never feels good, you feel lonely and that feeling can lead to radical idealism.

       "  \"In Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka, the main character Gregor wakes up one day to find that he had mysteriously transformed into a bug overnight. Despite this new realization, he quickly gets out of bed in a frenzy worrying about being late for work and the impact it could potentially have on his career. Although he notices differences starting the day, he fails to fully acknowledge the meaning of his transformation. After several interactions with others, he is left in a state of isolation with no one to reach out to or depend in times of need. This emphasizes that feeling isolated and out of place in life will eventually lead to one's downfall. For example, his father, a man who values success more than family, berades Gregor right from the beginning about his career is failed and how he no longer has any personal worth. He goes on to criticize Gregor about the choices he's made in the past and how his transformation should leave him feeling ashamed. This leaves Gregor feeling worthless as he has worked his whole life to please his father and make a name for himself. He also feels lost as he feels out of place from working toward his ambitions and knowing where life will take him. Any chance of hope to rekindle their relationship is erased when his father throws a book at his back. This leaves Gregor feeling embarassed, betrayed, and lonely beyond words as this epitomizes his downfall. Another example revolves around the relationship with his sister. Starting out, she continued to care for Gregor and look for him regardless of whether he was human or a bug. For a short while, this comforted Gregor as he knew someone saw worth in him. Unfortunately, this didn't last as he gradually went from eating human food and having a clean room to leftover garbage scraps and living amongst dirt and rotting garbage scraps. In many ways, this changing relationship was soul-crushing for Gregor as he was losing touch with those who he thought would hold on. This also signified a changing of the tide as it wasn't just his father who neglected  to see him for who he truly is. Overall, this idea caused great isolation to set in for Gregor as nobody could see him for who he had always been on the inside versus the outside changing. Lastly, his downfall can also be contributed to his tarnishing relationship with his mother. Similar to his sister, the mother starts out focusing on him being her son rather than a worthless bug. She continues this trend until others around her convince her that it is not longer worth trying to find the light at the end of the tunnel. Ultimately, the downfall of this relationship is the final dagger to any sense of hope that was still holding on for Gregor.&nbsp;\",\n",

By the end of the ball she rushes out in hopes to not be seen by anyone. Once she gets home she is left with a shockful discovery that she has lost the necklace. Her husband offers to tell her friend but her emberrasment didn\\'t allow her to come forward with the truth. The pair buy a new necklace, give it to her friend, and now are left in debt that they have to pay for the span of 10 years. She sees her friend at the park and her friend barely recognizes her due to how overworked our main character was. Our character then comes to find that the original necklace was a fake which costed only 500 francs and because of her shame to come forward, they had to pay 10,000 francs. Since the character felt out of place she turned into this greedy person who overall had to pay for the consequences of her actions. The interpretation of this work as a whole is that you don\\'t always have to fit into the crowd and that you should always be honest because you don\\'t know where that can lead you.',\n",

The tension of the play stems from the fact that the world\\'s realities often play in direct opposition to Willy\\'s distorted viewpoint. Willy modifies his family\\'s narrative in a way that alighns with his notion\\'s of the world such as adamently claiming his son\\'s are studly athletes and that he is a far better salesman than he actually is that in order to prevent himself from noticing that he is a lost soul in a world that has passed him by.<br><br>The play starts on Willy\\'s small townhouse being engulfed in a sea of monsterous apartment complexes, indicating from the play\\'s inception that Willy is out of place in this new world as he desperatly clings onto the past. <br><br>Willy is soon revealed as a salesmen who has constant day dreams of the past where he envisions his son\\'s, Biff and Happy, as \"adonases\" who are destined for success. These daydreams show that Willy feels out of place in this new reality and wishes to be transported to the past where the world was understandable for him. Willy boasts of his son\\'s athletic accomplishments and believes that they must be flaunted by women at their school. In reality its shown that Biff and Happy grow up to be merely mediocre athletes and sleezy lovers, with Happy constantly having affairs with his bosses wives and Biff becoming far too self concious to date. When presented this fact by his own son\\'s, Willy disregards their confession as simple modesty and brings up his fictionalized families past as evidence to their greatness. Willy detatches himself from reality because if he didn\\'t he would have to accept the shocking revilation that he doesn\\'t fit in the world any longer.<br><br>Willy\\'s ability to distort the truth extends to his work as well, for when his wife, Lydia, asks how much he made on a recent buisness trip to New York, he lies and gives a drastically inflated number. When Lydia congratulates him on his fantastic work Willy conceeds that he actually brought in a slightly lower figure than he initially claimed. Lydia, still impressed, explains that the sum is still more than enough. Willy, after this second round of conformation, confesses again that he exaggerated the second time as well. He continues this sharade until finally he reveals that he barely made enough to cover their living expenses. This is a prime example of how Willy is unable to accept the world\\'s lack of care for his salesmanship and his ultimate lack of place.<br><br>Willy\\'s lack of claiming responsibility for his detatchment is showed to be a trait that plauged even younger years, as his son Happy recounts suprising his father on one of his buisness trips only to find him having an affair with an associate. Willy felt like he wasn\\'t getting the praise he needed from his family or work so he subsidied it with this affair and when he is finally caught he refuses to admit to his cheating or to his feelings. Willy cannot except that he feels socially distant from the world so must turn to a world of lies once again. <br><br>Overall, Willy Loman is a man incredibly lost in a newfound social and economic world and instead of admitting to this displacement and coping with it normally, its easier for him to pretend that the world is different and one in which he still belongs.',\n",
       "  'Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0It can be easy to feel out of place in an unwelcoming environment, whether that be because of internal or external factors. In \"Frankenstein,\" by Mary Shelly, Victor Frankenstein\\'s monster is mentally and physically impacted by the negative experience of being shunned from society and his creator and his feeling contributes to the predominant theme of the intrinsic human need for companionship and the concept of nature vs. nurture. These themes are also predominant in our current society, from ostracization at schools to the feelings of children raised in orphanages.<br>Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Victor Frankenstein\\'s creation but subsequent rejection of the monster impacts the creature mentally as it feels out of place in a world that couldn\\'t accept him. From the beginning, the monster is thrown into a new environment without anyone to support or show him affection. He is forced to learn on his own by secretly watching others and reading books to broaden his knowledge, and he grows to understand that he is shunned soley due to his ghastly appearance, for which he had no control over. This demonstrates that his feeling of being out place leads him to develop independence quicker than he might have otherwise. This quick development, however, leads him to mentally suffer as he has no one to share his thoughts with as he knows there\\'s no one that would listen to such an aggregious creature. This additionally highlights the need for human companionship and comfort as it emphasizes the consequences on the mentalities of those deprived of connection. His feeling can be related to those of orphans in the foster care system in the US as many lack the oppurtunity to create deep connections and consequently have a higher statistical chance of getting into criminal affairs once being let out into the world without support systems in place.<br>Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The creatures upbringing hardens his temperment as he was exposed to the harsh realities of an unforgiving world so early in his development. The creature at one time attempts to save a child from drowing in a river, and is successful, but he recieves no gratitute and is instead attacked for what he percieved as a good deed. This highlights the physical impacts he faced as a result of his alientation from society as was injured in his innocent attempts to help a situation. This also underscores the interpretation of the concept of nature vs. nurture as the creature was not born malicious, but rather aquired his thirst for revenge and destruction as a product of his circumastances. Additionally, after his creator refuses of his one wish for companionship, the monster violently rebels, killing most of the people that Victor cherishes in his life. His hostile reaction is a result of his alienation from society and from his own creator as he is deprives of the one thing he longs for. Once again, this demonstrates that he is not an inherently evil being as he only wishes for a companion with innocent intentions, but the refusal of his request is what sets him over the edge as he is denied of any feeling of inclusion and is forced to suffer from the feeling of \"being out of place\" to an extreme extent once again. The monster can again be related to an innocent child that defaults to rebellion and violence after experiencing alientation due to a lack of counseling to guide them towards healthier methods of managing their feelings.<br>',\n",

So much so that he left him for over a week in the room because of the monsters appearance. Later on we see Frankenstein's monster be seen by other people, and they see him as a monster that should be killed due to its hidious appearence. And this story proves that appearances matter. People who are blessed with good looks and handsomeness and beauty, as more likely to get little things done for them like someone holding a door for you, getting your order right, treating you nicer, and you can get away with more like actual crimes and what not. And people who are more attractive are more likely to make friends and not feel as though they don't belong in a place they they do belong in. When it comes to the monster, he's not handsome, he's disfigured and unattractive. And due to these features he's case out due to something he can't control. The consequences that lead to him being mistreated are murder. He kills people because he would get upset, and since he was born like a couple weeks or months ago, he doesn't really understand that it is very bad to kill someone due to getting angry. But this is a consequence from society for treating like garbage. The funny thing is, the monster is really intellegent, he learns to read and write in different languages and learns some social skills. But these accomplishments, actual accomplishments, are overshadowed due to his appearance and peoples lack on sympothy, understanding and compassion for one another. Just having a bushy unibrow can cause people to speak less to you or avoid speaking to you entirely just for having a bushy unibrow. But outcasting someone is one of the most dangerous and evil things you can do.  It can cause mental health to decline, long last physical and psycoloical damage to the person. And that's just the beginning, when it come to the monster he is outcasted from the beginning of his life. Since he was born he was an outcast, a monster not fit for life, even though he was created out of a laboratory from human remains that were seen a beautiful. ANd this is what the story is tell us, abandoning someone will permentally damage someone, especially if you do it at a young age. Kids raised by just a father or just a mother don't develop correctly or entirely.

       "  \"In many books, films, short stories, and poems, isolation plays a big factor in many of the protagonist and antagonist characters motivations and behaviors. In the book The Handsmaids Tale, the female characters feeling of out of place, isolation, and feelings of belonging all contribute to the idea that isolating and individial for specific reasons, leads to the dehumanization and degradation of an entire group. In the Handsmaids Tale, women who are able to give birth are taken away, stripped of all rights, and turned into objects. One scene, where the main character June, witnesses this process of dehuminization, is when they were all forced to point and scream 'dirty!' and 'whore!' at a young girl who had been raped by their peer. This scene is not only revealing in the sense that its stripping the girls voice and story, it also affects the main character in the sense that in order to belong with the rest of the group, she has to cast out and degrade another. Another scene that relates to this idea of belonging is when after giving birth to a child, and going through the struggle of labor, she was casted out and was not allowed to hold her child. Seen and treated throughly as an object for the rich wives and husbands that rape them, the main characters friend ends up committing suicide. Instead of changing their behavior, the Handsmaids and other women were instead reminded of their place in society. While this is one of the many scenes that causes June to try and escape these moments of dehuminzation and isolation are very prevelant in todays political climate. Not only in the sense that a supreme court document was leaked yesterday declaring that Roe V Wade was to be overturned, essentally taking away the rights of millions of women, this book exposes of how many of these laws will push people in a situation where they will be isolated and feel out of place in society. Leading to an eventual degregation and dehumanization of these individals. Because of this, the quote 'that the Handsmaids Tale is about the future' is the best and most prevalent interpretation of this book.\",\n",

Throughout the novel <em>The Things They Carried</em>, the narrator Tim O'Brien gives accounts of stories during the Vietnam War. Many of these stories discussed O'Brien's personal encounters and difficulties he faced, while others discussed the stories of other soldiers. In the accounts, it was known that the aftermath of war destroyed the personal bodies of many soldiers, causing them to feel out of place within their own bodies. After the war, many soldiers suffered from PTSD, a disorented mental state, flashbacks, mental disorders, and physical body issues as well. The issues that each soldier and person faced after and even during the war made soldiers feel worthless. Soldiers felt uncomfortable in their own bodies and were afraid to show themselves after war.  In the specific instances of Tim, he suffered from several mental  and emotional trauma, anxiety, and PTSD. He was then forced to deal with the aftermath of these emotions for the rest of his life. For O'Brien, there was a lack of treatments for his condiitons, making his situation even worse. This widely known feeling of O'Brien demonstrates the conditions that himslef and many other soldiers faced, since so many soldiers knew that they were not mentally and physically stable in their own bodies. There should be a wider push for our society to be more accepting and understanding of those who have been through trauma such as war. If this was able to happen, people such as O'Brien and his fellow soldiers would be able to feel more confident in knowing there are countless other people dealing with mental disorders and trauma as well, and that they are not the only people feeling 'out of place' with themselves.&nbsp;\",\n",

Throughout the book we witness the experiences the creature has to endure, simply because of his phsyical, mental, and emotional differences from mankind. To begin with his own creator was terrified of what he had created, and his first experience from being brought to life was fear from the first person he had encountered. Unlike majority of individuals who gradually experience the feeling out of place, they at least had loving interaction from family and parents as children. Frankenstein's creature had never recieved that welcome from others, and the person who would most likely welcome him was terrified of his own creation. This leads to negative affect on the creature because he is now going out into the world with no prior knowldege or understanding of the way society works. He is also different from other humans, so he has not learned enough about himself and doesn't have someone to guide him through life. His confusion and lack of knowledge causes him to go looking for Franstein and in the process of doing so, he begins to grow hatred for his creator. The reader begins to notice the character devlopment in Frankensteins creature, he went from a frightened and confused to someone who begins to feel emotions, especially showing his depise for frankenstein. Then there is another encounter with a family that he spent time observing from a distance, and this is the first time the audience witnesses the creature's desire for human interaction.

       "  \"In <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em> (1998), Barbara Kingsolver recounts the story of a white American missionary family that is displaced to the imperialist Belgian Congo. Through their experience, she highlights the cultural divide between the family (the Prices) and the seemingly less civilized way of life within the Congo, all while in the midst of a rising sociopolitical upheaval. Many of the characters within this family additionally have difficulty coming to terms with their new environment and find themselves rendered unable to translate their Westernized dispositions into this situation, and consequently feel invariably out of place. This is particularly demonstrated in the character of Leah Price, who is open-minded and curious about the Congolese but instead becomes insecure over her inability to truly assimilate with them because of her race and the connotations of her whiteness; as well as Rachel Price, whose racist dispositions and narrow-mindedness cause her to superficially regard the Congolese as inferior, consequently causing her to become disgusted by their culture and society by their virtue of being African. These characterizations consequently contribute to <em>Poisonwood</em>'s thematic exploration of race and culture as Kingsolver portrays demographic to be a superficial barrier to mutual human understanding.&nbsp;\",\n",

       " 5: ['In a patriarchal society it is difficult for a women to feel in place with her community, her strengths, society, and her own body, this issue can be observed through many female characters in literary works and history, more specifically in the characterization of Blanche Dubois, in Tenessee Williams\\' play, <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, in which Blanche\\'s anger, confusion, and desperateness in her situation controls both her own fate and the others around her. Blanche Dubois is the sister of Stella, whom she lives with throughout the plot along with Stella\\'s abusive husband. Blanche was formerly a woman who lived a comfortable lifestyle, and did not have to rely on herself to afford her comfortability. Throughout the plot Blanche is seemingly antagonized as she decieves men, controls her sister, has innapropriate relationships with minors, and progressively gets more and more mad. A lot of Blanche\\'s behaivior is objectively inexusable, but it is extremely important to observe the significance of her circumstances and situations to understand her choices, and character as a whole. During the early twentieth century in which the story was written, women often had no mobility in their society, and had to rely on men, or being born into wealth in order to live a comfortable lifestyle. Blanche no longer had either of these options to survive, which forced her into moving in with her sister to sustain herself, which eventually turns into the downfall of her life. Throughout her time in her sister\\'s penthouse she is overly dramatic, and materialistic and deceptive as she attempts to find a way to sustain her preffered ways of life. She decieves men and uses her fading beauty in hopes that a man can save her once again. To Blanche, her way of living and the only way that she can find a place in society is to be under the care of a man. Due to the way that society is structured, Blanche continues to set up lies toward other people and herself, to cover up the feelings of emptiness and unfulfilment that society forces her to endure. Blanche uses dark lighting, makeup, and persistent flirting, as tools that she mastered the use of to control men in her life, so that she is able to live in a home, and have money that she cannot make on her own. Eventually this becomes Blanches character, her only way of knowledge and sense of aspirations as it was pushed onto her as a way to survive in her society. Blanche herself states that she has always depended on the kindness of strangers. The complexity in this highlights that it is not necessarily in Blanches moral favorability to be a free loader, but because of her position as a woman in a patriarchal society she has no choice but to rely on others to keep her in a state of society thyat she is forced into to begin with. One way that can be identified that Blanche is more complex than her decetive actions is when she defends Stella against her abusive husband and attempts to persuade her to leave her marriage. From this we can understand that Blanche is extremely aware of the role that men and women play in society, Blanche can identify abuse and harm from men yet she also understands how it is a women\\'s role to learn to take that abuse in order to live. Yet Blanche stll looks for alternatives for her and her sister to live safely, even if its under the arm of another man. Throughout the plot, Blanche essentially adheres to the role of a \"woman\", not necessarily a role that it is true to herself, but a role she must oblige to in order to fit in, in order to live. She uses material such as cheap, decorative paper lanterns and makeup to hide and conceal a woman who is desperate, who is going mad from a society who has drove her to the shell of her own self, who seeks security in the very thing that continues to ruin her time and time again. As Blanche does what se can with the knowledge and resources she has in order to overcome her situation, she spirals and gets progressively worse as a human being, and is sentanced to her psych ward, while her sister stays in her penthouse with her abusive husband. In <em>A Streetcar Named Desire </em>it is not purely the displacement that Blanche feels throughout the sense of the plot, it is the way that society forces Blanche to feel displaced, consistently repremands her for coming up with forced solutions, feeling emotions, and finds solace in immoral ways, and eventually she becomes the antagonist that society has made her up to be.',\n",
       "  \"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Brave New World</em>, the character John is out of place within the society of the book, due to being raised in the completely different environment of the Savage Reservation. His feeling out of place from the rest of the members of society causes him to reject soma and deal with pain, react dramatically to his mother's death and eventually his own suicide. The effects of him feeling out of place illustrate the author's theme that being different within one's own society can cause one to become destructive towards others and towards themselves.<br>     Being raised within the Savage Reservation, John never learned to rely on soma like the rest of the people within the society of <em>Brave New World.</em> Like readers, he viewed soma as escapism and not solving any problems people had in their lives. As a result, he refuses to use soma like the rest of the characters and succumbs to feeling more emotional pain than anyone else. Although the rejection of soma is appropriate for one who never relied on it, it causes him to deliberately feel more pain. His approach to pain over relying on soma like everyone else symbolizaes how being raised with different customs and traditions, although not inherently wrong, can cause one to deal with more pain and suffering than others simply because they are different. John's relationship with soma causes him to be destructive towards others, shaming his mother for indulging in it, as well as himself for never wanting to rely on it and feeling more pain. <br>     John refused to live within the society of <em>Brave New World. </em>He felt the need to live alone away from society despite the pain that it caused him, because he simply would rather suffer than live in the society he did not belong in. He lives his final days on a remote island praying to God and whipping himself for his sinful thoughts. After his privacy is intruded by the people again, after indulging in sexual activities with them he feels he had betrayed his own beliefs and takes his life. John refusing to live within society and trapping himself alone with his thoughts and whipping himself reflects how he preferred pain and suffering in solitude than living within a society that he could not pretend to accept. Losing human interaction, John feels more and more pain, but is content living like so. After he had been tempted by his sexual desires and sexually indulged with the people that had come to his island to watch him, he takes his own life as a means of justice for his actions. John's death reflects how he would have rather died than to live like the others that he had long rejected, showing how being out of place within one's own society can cause one to be destructive towards themselves. <br>     John being raised outside the society of <em>Brave New World</em> and not accepting the same idea of death puts him out of place from everyone. When John witnesses his mother's death, rejecting his society's belief that death was peaceful and meaningless, he refuses to let his mother die painlessly and tries to wake her up from her soma trip, scaring the children that are nearby. Because of John's different beliefs from his society, he tries to cause his mother to feel pain during her death, and crying miserably in front of all the children who are supposed to be conditioned to be desensitized towards death. Not only does John feels immense pain at his mother's death, he inflicts pain and damage on the people around him at the moment in an attempt to have someone that sympathized with him. His lack of others' sympathy causing him to inflict pain on others reflects how being alone and different can cause one to be destructive towards others.&nbsp;\",\n",
       "  \"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the story Frankenstein, the creature depicted in the story is literally shunned from society. This ultimately causes the creature to feel abandoned with no sense of belonging and causes it to develop negative feelings towards society. The creature's experience of feeling out of place helps build the universal truth that society is cruel especially towards those who are simply different from them.<br>    Firstly, the upbringing of the creature is unique and unlike and member of society portrayed in the story Frankenstein. For example, the creature was born through unnatural means and electricity as opposed to being conceived through the womb like everybody else in the story. Despite Viktor being the creature's maker, it was Viktor's responsibility to father the creature accordingly. Society's cruelty towards the creature is first seen through Viktor's neglecting of the creature. This abandonment led to the creature feeling out of place and ultimately steered the creature towards a path of revenge alone. This revenge is later seen through the murder of Viktor's spouse. Viktor's neglect reinforces the idea of how cruel humans can be towards those that are different.<br>    Secondly, another instance in which the creature feeling out of place affecting the character is seen through the following example. The creature saved a young girl from death and was repaid with a bullet wound. Despite the creature going out of his way to do a kind deed that in no way benefitted him, the creature was repaid with cruelty. The girl's father trying to rid of the creature because of it's differences further establishes the creature feeling out of place. The creature's interactions with the young girl and the father harmed the creature physically and only caused the creature to feel even more out of place. The cruelties and fear portrayed by the young girl and father further solidify the idea that humans can be cruel towards individuals that are different.<br>    Lastly, another moment another moment where the creature is forced out of society can be seen through his interactions with the villagers. The creature went out of his way to do kind deeds for the villagers such as providing food when he did not need to. Once the villagers were aware it was the creature giving them supplies, they chased the creature out of their village all because the creature looked different. After these events unfolded, the creature felt even more alone than he previously did and had no sense of belonging despite the good he tried to provide for others. The creature feeling out of place caused the creature to develop an even stronger resentment towards society. Through the villagers cruel interactions with the creature, this helps show how humans can be cruel towards anything they deem different.<br>    All in all, the creature is consistently wronged by society. The unjustified cruelty and shunning the creature undergoes pushes the creature onto a path of resentment. With that being said, the creature is an embodiment of the universal truth of how humans can be so cruel to those that are different.\",\n",
       "  'In Zora Neale Hurston\\'s novel <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, the abuse that Janie endured within all of her romantic relationships, specifically with her partner Tea Cake, all propelled her journey of self-discovery and exploration further, as she would not have been able to find herself and her own, authentic voice without losing parts of herself along the way first. Hurston was intentional in her promotion of the following message: Good things never come easy. Following Tea Cake\\'s death at the end of the novel, for the first time, Janie wills herself to both recognize and embrace the newfound solitude that was presented in front of her. Throughout the entire course of the novel, Janie was both physically and emotionally abused by all of her romantic partners, including Logan Killicks, Jody Starks, and most infamously, Tea Cake. Because she did not know any better at the time, Janie assumed that this kind of treatment was normal, for it was up to her to fulfill her role as the \"dutiful\" and \"attentive\" wife that endured all of her husband\\'s abuse, no matter how severe or emotionally-scarring it may have been. Throughout the course of the entire story, the reader sees Janie transition from one relationship to the other, usually very quickly, and it becomes apparent that she cannot handle or embrace the feeling of being alone. After she ran away from Logan, she soon met Jody, and once Jody died, she immediately came into contact with Tea Cake. But, after Tea Cake died, a switch went off in Janie\\'s head and something drastic changed: \"Janie no longer felt the burden of being alone. Now, there was a certain light about her,\" (Hurston, 134). Previously, Janie absolutely loathed the idea of not having a partner or living alone, however, after taking into account everything that she endured in the past year, Janie had discovered her own voice and above all, the sheer significance and value of independence and trust. While many assume that trust is something that always has to be shared among two people in a relationship or a group of people in general, Janie came to recognize that the most important form of trust is to herself, and no one else. Although a clichÃ©, everything does happen for a reason, which is yet another lesson that Janie took away and carried with her following Tea Cake\\'s death. During the gun standoff, Janie found herself in the midst of a \"do or die situation\" where one wrong move may have cost her her life. When push came to shove, Janie did what she had to do and for the very first time in her life, put herself first. While the abuse that Janie had to go through should not be wished on anyone, without having endured it, Janie would not be the woman that she grew to be at the end of the novel. Their can be no light without darkness and no sun without a storm.',\n",

When you are put into a world where you have no connections , no comfort , no knowledge of who you are as a person, it is easy to fall under the control of someone else . In the beginning of the novel ,Celie was abused and mistreated by even her own family , her father. She believed the only way to make him happy was to obey and to do everything that he would ask of her. Celie was unaware of her self worth as a woman and failed to use her power against him; she felt she had no other choice, it was a battle between a man who was both physically and mentally stronger than she could ever be . It\\'s not to say that Celie\\'s life of misery was due to her own fault; in fact it goes to show the consequences that follow when you are being blinded from the world; when you have no idea of the power and control you hold within yourself.        <br>     Turning to someone can sometimes be the best strategy . Men can sometmes have a mysogynistic and sexist mindset, they believe that a woman is only meant for housework and for breeding , however when it\\'s their turn to be put in place by a woman, they use their power of masculinity to remind them of who is in control. As for Shug Avery , this was not in her familiarity. Shug was a singer who attracted and finessed the liking of many men , including Celies husband ,who used to be her past lover. Despite the fact that Shug had no interest towards Celie , Celie admired her as a whole . She loved her body , her way of behavior , and the way she could be accepted into society, which was everything Celie wished to have.

In analyzing a slave's loss of belonging, one can even compromise their own psyche. However, it is often seen that those peeking back through the obscured lens of the modern period decide to engage with, define, and share the actualities of southern slavery. In this cruel, burdensome misson, these creators offer audiences the opportunity to reveal what is perhaps a time capsule of a devastation decades from today, but, simultaneously, all too near. Instead of numerals and equations to calculate the travesty, however, these storytellers utilize words and syntax to revive the egregious truths of this era. <em>Beloved,</em> a book authored by Toni Morrison, is founded on these truths. While the narrative itself is a piece of historical fiction and explores paranormal concepts, the novel ties itself to the utter barbarism of US slavery. Yet, the audience discovers that Sethe, the protagonist, has become numb to the happenings of this aforementioned, unyielding memory, and she surrenders to its haunting of the present. With a potent, tragic telling, Beloved reveals to us a character who feels gone from herself due to her torturous servitude,  her bloody murder of her daughter, and the community's banishment of her from their social circles.&nbsp;\",\n",

Whether it be the decades ago, at the Seneca Falls Convention to further the women's voting rights, or more recently, within Roe v. Wade deciding the rights and privacy of women in the medical field, there has always been a fight to achieve better rights and thus, better lives for women. Even through the decades of fighting, though, women have been and always will be at a disadvantage due to the strict expectations of society. In her novel, <em>The Awakening, </em>Kate Chopin explores this very idea of women struggling as a result of societal norms. Specifically, Edna Pontellier, the protagonist of the riveting story, feels incredibly out of place in society as she awakens to find her independence and creativity. Through her use of complex character analogies, as well as a prominent symbol throughout the story, Chopin makes a bold statement for her time that, women, like Edna herself, who feel out of place and must struggle through obstacles to feel truly happy, are essentially placed in shackles of persecution by society's rigid roles and expectations.&nbsp;\",\n",
       "  'At some point or other, it is inevitable that each individual will carry a sense with them that they do not belong, perhaps not anywhere; this is just human nature. Likewise, in literature, many characters initially have a sense that they fail to belong, and then over the course of the novel, the character morphs into a more self-confident individual who has created a place for themself. Interetingly, in Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, the opposite occurs. Victor Frankenstein\\'s Creature initially feels relatively content with the life he leads the first few years after his \"birth,\" however, upon learning about families and relationships, as well as realizing that, unless a companion is created from him, he will fail to experience these joys, the Creature grows increadibly wary of those around him, and his entire viewpoint towards life switches from relative contentedness to contempt and a feeling that he does not belong.

He is confined to his room, away from his work, life, and family becaue he is out of place as a creature that is no longer human and connected to society.

Through this alienating experience, he realizes that his life is passionless, and he lived to provide for his family, more like a servant than a son, working himself to death, yet never reaping the awards. This illuminate the work as a whole as Gregor's epiphany convey's Kafka's commentary that society pressures humans to work endlessly to their death to gain status and money, to the point where living as an isolated, loveless, and lifeless vermin would lead a life just as unfulfilling and meaningless.&nbsp;\",\n",

Jane Eyre, although lacking in connection and extremely distant to her peers, grows through these disabilitys to find a healthy relationship and contentment through her vocation in life.&nbsp;\",\n",
       "  \"In music, the rules of what notes can be used in a melody are dictated by the key signature. This key signature acts as a guide or outline to what notes must be changed in order to adhere to the structure of the other pitches around that note. If a key is placed into a melody or harmony and it is not found in the key signature, often times the result is that the note will stick out like a sore thumb, as it is so obviously out of place in comparision to the pitches around it. A literary work that is similar to this idea would be J.D. Salinger's<em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> which details the journey of Holden Caulfield, who, like a note not in the key signature, feels out of place as he battles his inner strife of adhering to social expectations while getting older. Salinger includes Holden's experiences while at school as well as in the city that illuminate how out of place Holden is, ultimately suggesting that maturing includes the exploration of the unknown, and that child-like innoncence cannot be preserved.\",\n",

In addition to this, not a single person that you have met on your journey has shown you a bit of compassion once they see you for what you are. In Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em>, the Creature is brought to life by Victor Frankenstein and immediately abandoned out of fear and disgust at his appearance. Victor meddled with forces far beyond his control, but refused to deal with the consequences of his actions. As a result, he abandoned his child and left him to barely survive on his own. The Creature journeys across Europe, trying to find his creator, and when Victor continues to neglect him he begins to kill the people closest to Victor. Victor's constant neglect and alienation of his creation and the consequences that followed are proof that parents of any kind owe compassion and family to their children, and are responsible for whatever results occur if they fail to do so.\",\n",

At their fathers' requests, not their own, they were often married off and forced to submit to the life-long duties of mother, wife, and homemaker without ever choosing that path for themselves. Those that found themselves unmarried past the spinster age of 25 often became schoolteachers, earning scraps of wages at a thankless job. Few women found ways to escape this societal expectation, and those that did often felt very out of place in society.

In the novel <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>by J. D. Salinger, Holden Caufield is caught out of place from society as a whole.

       " 6: ['In the novel <em>The Awakening</em>, by Kate Chopin, the protagonist Edna Pontellier feels greatly out of place in her societal role as mother, wife, and creative creature. This tension between her desire for independence and the context in which she finds herself contributes greatly to her change as a character throughout the novel and her crisis point at the end of it, and is ultimately integral to the novel\\'s conflicts and its themes of radical independence and the feeling of suffocation and frustration under societal repression and expectation.<br>     To begin with, Edna feels repressed and unsatisfied with the current her current romantic and sexual relationship with her husband. Her interactions with him throughout the novel are cold and increasingly frictitious as the novel goes on. Her and her husband have trouble relating to each other, and once Edna begins to explore her newfound sense of freedom by avoiding certain social functions and taking time out of her day for activities such as painting, he admonishes her. At the same time as she feels no warmth toward her husband, Edna feels a great romantic attraction to a man named Robert, and, when Robert leaves for Mexico to avoid causing too much tension by being seen with Edna, she settles for an extramarital affair with a man named Alcee Arobin, which causes some gossip and disaproval among her social circle, partially because he is known as being unserious. Even the doctor in the novel, who is generally at least understanding of Edna\\'s eccentricities, hopes that she is not having an affair with Arobin. In this way, Edna\\'s experience of feeling out of place as a wife contributes to her growing sense throughout the novel that one should have the ability to choose who one loves, which comes into some conflict with the difficulty of enacting this within the societal constraints of her time. This, in turn, exemplifies the human need for some level of independence (and some of the consequences of it), as well as the frustration with common social mores evidenced throughout the novel. <br>     Edna is also uncomfortable with her familial and, essentially, occupational role as a caretaker. While she does love her two children, she has difficulty relating to them, and finds it tiresome and often not worth it to attend to their every need. Unlike some of her friends, who are comfortable and happy in the role of a \"mother-woman,\" Edna finds it uncomfortable, exhausting, and frequently incomprehensible. It is hinted throughout the novel that to some extent she regrets that, having had children, she now has an obligation to devote her life to them. She even expresses this when she says that she would die for her children but not give up her life for them. Edna\\'s out-of-place feeling of intense obligation and some exhaustion with her role as a mother, as well as the way that she describes the role as something different from mere womanhood - being a \"mother-woman,\" leads her to more and more independent actions and open rejections of her role (such as acknowledging her happiness when her children go to New York for a vacation), and contributes to the themes of independence and societal repression and expectation by showing that certain social obligations, even arguably positive ones like motherhood, can take away one\\'s full life and humanity.<br>   Throughout the novel, Edna takes steps to establish herself as separate from her societal role, such as moving out of her house. Ultimately, however, Edna cannot bring herself to completely reject all societal customs that pain her, or at least to do so and live with that decision. When she perceives that she must chooses between living with Robert and her obligations to be a good mother to her children, she cannot bring herself to choose, and instead drowns trying to swim out to sea. This shows how Edna\\'s desire for independence eventually consumes her entire being and leads her to reject a world that will not let her free herself from all obligation. In this way, the ultimate message of Edna\\'s character, and to some extent the story as a whole, is a certain level of despair at the idea of meaningfully reconciling the potentially infinite human desire for independence that Edna feels and the place in society in which she found herself.<br>     Whether as a mother or partner, Edna continually finds herself feeling out of place throughout <em>The Awakening</em>, and while she eventually finds the stress of her position too much to bear, her feelings of isolation and incongruity eventually reveal the novel\\'s main message about the persistant conflict between independence and social and societal obligation, and the ways in which that conflict was particularly stifling and overwhelming for 19th century women like Edna.&nbsp;',\n",
       "  \"Everybody is treated equally in the army. Same outfits, same training, same gravestones. Obviously, none of that is functionally true, but that's the sentiment often given by war novels and movies. To be a soldier is a brave and noble thing, it means risking one's life for their country and dying an honorable death. Catch-22 is a book that stomps all over this sentiment, painting the military as an absurdly unfair, explotative, and cruel system. Its messaging is highlight by its protagonist, a young man named Yossarian. Yossarian is a contrarion by nature, often finding ridiciulous ways to get out of following orders or pulling insane stunts to try and be sent home. He's in sharp contrast to many of the men around him, most of which are either freshly 18 or actual children, who do as their told and keep their heads down. Yossarian's insistence in being out of place in the army is what makes Catch-22 effective as a piece of satire as it highlights the absurdities of the military. <br><br>Yossarian doesn't want to fly any more missions. The number of missions he needs to go on keeps raising and he just wants to go home. His methods of trying to avoid flying his missions are often humorous, but his rebellious attitude puts in focus how predatory this whole system really is. Everyone except Yossarian keeps flying their missions, risking their lives on every one because they're told it's the right thing to do. The people in charge are willing to let them die if it means making them look good, and they themselves are willing to die if they're instructed to. Yossarian is a little older than a lot of the men he works with, being 28 compared to a lot of kids of 18 and even younger. Yossarian's eager preservation of his own life makes light of how these men are throwing their lives away for practically nothing, just because it was crammed into their heads that they're doing something noble or glorious. It's horrifying to see that Yossarian is the only one willing to take drastic measures to protect himself and how he's seen as an outcast and a lunatic for doing so. Yossarian not wanting to die at the hands of the majors and generals that keep trying to take advantage of him is unpatriotic and a danger to the whole system. Why is the whole system based on taking advantage of people who don't know any better? Isn't Yossarian the only reasonable one here? <br><br>Yossarian cares deeply about other people, and that's a quality unique to him and only a few other characters in the book. He's incredibly affected by the death of another soldier, Snowden, and this death haunts him throughout the entire book. He sees this young man's blood on his hands and he feels the weight of his death every second he's up in the sky, knowing he could so easily meet the same fate. For comparison, another solider named Milo goes to Snowden's funeral and spends about two lines grieving his death before transitioning into talking about himself and how he can make more money. An individual person's death isn't important in war, it just isn't. Yossarian being so concerned with one person or another dying is unusual. Everyone else is used to the idea of death, completely desentized to it after seeing it so often. But of course, the reader feels for Yossarian and recognizes the horror of death being treated so lightly by everyone in the book. Of course every person's life matters, why are they acting like it's not a big deal? Yossarian being so avoidant to death makes him a bad soldier, but it makes him a character that's easily sympathized with and a mirror that reveals how cruel the military can be. <br><br>Yossarian is horribly out of place in the military and desperately tries to find a way out of his duties again and again. The fact that he's so disillusioned with the system is what makes Catch-22's satire land, being told from the point of view of someone that doesn't believe in the propoganda he's been fed about war. He gives an outsider's perspective while still being fully entrenched in the horrors of the military. Catch-22 wouldn't work without Yossarian, and Yossarian couldn't exist as a character if he wasn't exposed to such an absurd and explotative system.&nbsp;\",\n",
       "  'When the game of lying gets taken out of context or taken too far, the consequences can be deadly. White lies can turn into a spiraling web of lies that makes something that is innocent look deceitful. On the more severe side of lying, holding in a lie can cause the heart or morals, everything that one stands for to be their dying proclamation. In Nathaniel Hawthorne\\'s <em>The Scarlet Letter, </em>he uses symbolism and allusion to the bible through the character of Dimmesdale, to represent how static morals and traits can be changed. The character of Dimmesdale can be described as a puritan Atlas, carrying the whole town of Salem and its secrets, on his back. Dimmesdale is represented through the color white and black. The white, standing for innocence and purity, and the black for sins and darkness. Knowing of the secrets that he holds he hides away from the community, keeping his thoughts, words, and actions locked up, only for them to resurface and boil over. The color symbolism also appears with the brand on his chest, the red A. The red signifys the bond of blood and love. He is bonded by blood to Hester through Pearl and in doing so, has found love for the both of them. The symbolism of him branding himself with the A stands for the burden he carries, and the secrets he holds dear to heart as well. The allusion to the bible comes with Dimmesdale character with the A he brands into his chest. One of the long standing sins of Christianity is commiting adultry. The burden around his heart acts as a punishment by God for the sins that he has commited. This breaks Dimmesdale down, losing a part of his faith, his morals, as he believes that God is punishing him by tempting his fate. Dimmesdale until the burden was lifted off his chest, felt out of place, both by his moral standings and community by having ties to the \"wretched\" Hester and \"spawn of the devil\" Pearl.  At the end of the novel, his character traits change, instead of hiding from Hester, he wants to be free with her. Throwing away the oath he swore to the church and wanting peace in his life for once, away from the all knowing eye of the church. His death also symbolzes the cleansing of his sins, as well as Hester\\'s too. This is also alluding to the bible, as it refrences the crusifixtion of Christ, and how his death forgave the sins of all.  Through lying the very traits that make up one\\'s personality can be changed, whether its that the mask that someone puts up finally comes crashing down or they change to match what they believe is right. The character of Dimmesdale changes both morally and character wise, as he goes from a morally static figure, to being more morally fluid as his beliefs change as a result of the events in <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> by Nathaniel Hawthorne.',\n",

In Nazi Germany, political disenters would be sent to concentration camps or simply killed, while in Stalinist Russia political disseneters would be sent to Gulags or killed.

In the first half of the book, Mersaultes \"goes through the motions\" of his life, feeling nothing for his mother\\'s death and experiencing only sensations in the activities he engages with, whether that be the heat of his mother\\'s funeral procession or the breeze on the beach he frequents with Marie. Only through experiencing the boredom of prison, the bureaucracy of the French legal system, and the extremist views of the religious chaplain  does Mersaultes finally express his emotion. Ultimately, Mersaultes identity as a social outcast and his growth throughout experiencing the oppression of various apparatus in French society allow him to come to cherish pre-prison experiences. Although Mersaultes\\' unique personality is responsible for his own decisions that potrays himself as a villain in French society, Camus suggests that it\\'s the apparatus (legal system, prison, religios intolerance) that acts as the real villain in <em>The Stranger</em>, unwilling and unable to provide the aide and resources for those like Mersaultes that are misunderstood and out of place in society.',\n",

This is especially true for Gregor Samsa, the protagonist of the absurdist novella, <ins>The Metamorphosis</ins> by Franz Kafka, and through the ordeal of dealing with the adversities of being transformed into a large insect, Gregor is separated socially and physically from the people he loves while Kafka embarks on attempting to discern the philosophical argument of rejecting those that are out of place in society or attempting to facillitate them to a greater level of self-achievement. In <ins>The Metamorphosis</ins>, the feeling of being out of place affects Gregor in a way that makes him percieve his ownself as a hideous creature to others lives as people see his physical appearance, which contributes to the work as a whole through the central philosphical argument of rejecting those who are out of place to improve ones own potential or accepting them yet limiting oneself's potential.\",\n",

       "  'In <em>The House on Mango Street</em>, the main character grows up as a child of first-generation immigrants to the United States struggling to keep a large family afloat with only two sources of income. She is one of the younger siblings, and in addition to her older siblings splitting off into cliques of their own, she lacks respect from all due to her naivete. The combination of these experiences alienates the main character from her family and then once more from the friends she surrounds herself with. Moreso, in a neighborhood of scattered ethnic identities which prioritizes whiteness and conformity, the family is further alienated from their culture and their language. The lack of attachment the main character experiences throughout <em>The House on Mango Street </em>influences her experience growing up and how the reader experiences sexism, racism, and prejudice alongside the main character as her story progresses.&nbsp;']}"
