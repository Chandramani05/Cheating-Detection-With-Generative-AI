0,"Honestly, at this point, I give up. I don't know what to say or what to do, but I am trapped here in this hell of my own creation. I am stuck in a never-ending cycle of destruction, pain, and misery. I hate the person who I have become. I hate the person I see in the mirror.

I thought that every day was supposed to be a learning experience, that you end the day with more experience and knowledge than you started it with. But every day, I wake up and I feel empty. I feel empty and hollow inside. I'm trying to find something that gives me meaning in life, but I haven't found it yet.

I thought that the click of a ratchet, the acrid smells of gasoline, oil, and rubber would make me whole by filling the hole in my life. But that didn't last. It only numbs me from my reality until life lobs a wrench at me and shatters the window of escapism I reside in.

I thought if I couldn't find joy in wrenching, then I could find joy in riding. But the squeal of the tires and the sights of the desolate road, stretching out into the void of blackness far beyond what the human eye can see, doesn't evoke in me an emotional response anymore either.

I thought that when all I could see was the slick, reflective tarmac racing past me, when all I could hear was the repeated cycle of intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust cycling at 6000 times per minute, in that moment, for however brief it would be, I thought that I could be complete. I expected catharsis, yet I only found numbness once again.

I find everyone around me to be a monument to my sins, to my failures and shortcomings, to be demonstrative of the types of people I could have become if I just applied myself enough. And that's the funny thing. I wish so dearly that I could sink into my pit of despair and depression because, in a sense, there is a certain comfort in it. But I can't bring myself to admit that I'm a failure.

I am so deathly afraid of letting others down and letting myself down. Yet, I don't have the drive, the passion, the energy to do anything about my current situation. My own inaction puts me in a torturous limbo. I hate it. I hate everything and everyone around me. I feel as if I'd be better off dead. But I'm too much of a coward to act upon my convictions.

Why does everyone think of me so highly? What do others see in me that I am unable to see in myself? Yo, to whoever is grading this right now, if you have even read this far, I'm only doing this to pass the time and to get stuff off of my chest. I've always sucked at essay writing and writing in general.

It's better not to try at this point because you can at least coddle your pride and tell yourself that if you actually tried, you'd have done better. It's easier to do that than to admit to yourself that you're a fraud, that you don't understand what you're doing or what is going on. I am incapable of growing as a person. I am trapped. I am lonely. And I know that there is no one else who can pull me out of this other than myself.

But pulling myself out of this would be to acknowledge the truth and the world around me, and I don't want to. I sincerely do not want to do that. The amount of emotional distress, pain, and vulnerability that would cause wouldn't make the catharsis of seeing myself improve be worth it. Sure, the truth shall set you free, but the consequences of your actions will throw you right back into your cell again, damned for all eternity just to repeat the same cycle over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

All I do is destroy other people. I put on a veneer of a nice kid who keeps to himself. But it's just that. A veneer. There is no great future for me. Even when everything is going in my favor, I find a way to have it blow up in my face. I hate all of it. I never asked to be born. I never asked for all the implications of being a ""GT kid"". But yet here I am. All because people perceive a version of me that's not really genuine or authentic."
0,"I am not going to lie. Seeing the stupid words, ""In a well-written essay, analyze how this experience of feeling out of place affects the character and contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot,"" and sitting here knowing good and well that I am not going to do that one single bit makes me feel so good. These worthless tests make me sick.

I am a fantastic writer, always have been, and we had to write tens of these in class for preparation of this class. I always got 100% on all of them, so it is funny to me that I am completely blowing off the only one that actually matters. I had to give my actual effort to the in-class ones because they affected my grade. I think I'm finishing the class with a 93%-95%, somewhere around there. And here I am about to get a 1 on the AP Exam. What a wonderful and effective education system we have. Truly beautiful. A masterpiece. A real work of art. Absolutely mind-blowing. Stunning!

I am so ready for college to study something I actually care about and can put my effort into because I want to, not because I HAVE to. The pain of high school schoolwork is really unmatched as it is all so useless and worthless. I'm going into business and property management to hopefully end up acquiring a lot of my own real estate and become a real estate investor. I have done countless hours of research on the topic and watched many YouTube videos about it. I am pretty confident that is what I want to do with my life. There's lots of money to be made in the field as well. YouTube gets discounted as a reliable source, but there is seriously some incredible stuff on there completely free of charge. I watch Ben Mallah, a very wealthy real estate investor who regularly shares tips and tricks on how to make the most money possible on real estate. He is funny and entertaining as well. I watch them for enjoyment and quickly realized I was learning a lot as a result.

I am never going to need any knowledge of poetry, how to analyze a passage, what literary devices are used in writing, or anything else that falls into the category of the complete BS we have been forced to learn throughout high school. It makes me sick. I can pick out alliteration in a passage and know how to solve for x, but guess what? I have no idea how to pay my taxes, make car payments, mortgage payments, how to take out a loan, how to get good insurance, I could go on for days. The education system in the United States of America is the most ridiculous and pathetic thing I think I have ever witnessed. But guess what? I have two weeks left, and I never have to complain about it again.

Don't get me wrong, high school has been a BLAST. I have a huge group of all very close friends that I have done everything with the past four years. Sporting events, dances, outside activities, and more have all been absolutely amazing because I chose to surround myself with people that make me laugh and make me happy. Those are the keys to life. Surrounding yourself with people you love and laughing."
0,"I am in an interesting predicament, and I'm not quite sure what to do, so I will use this as a journal entry of sorts. I work at this Boy Scout camp over the summers, and there is this girl who I've gotten really close with. At first, we were just friends, but out of nowhere, she asked me to prom. Luckily, I had a good excuse not to go. However, I kept telling myself that she asked me as a friend, but she kept texting me. Recently, we had a staff training weekend where I got to see her, and now I'm catching feelings for her. I think she likes me too, but the only problem is that she is almost two years younger than me. I don't know what to do because I know that's not a big gap in the grand scheme of things, but it doesn't change the fact that at this point in time, it's a little odd, not to mention illegal. I also don't know how my parents or her parents would take it.

So, I'm thinking that we just date platonically and tell her that we can tell our parents when she turns 18. However, she also has to try to go to the same college as me because I can't do long distance for more than 2 years, and even then, it would still be hard. Honestly, I wish I did not like her, but we get along surprisingly well. I don't understand why I like her. She isn't even that attractive, so it kind of confuses me. But I'll figure out a solution to my problem eventually, or maybe nothing will come of it, which isn't necessarily what I want, but I think it would definitely be the best outcome.

The problem is, at this point, I'm going to hurt myself because I keep imagining a life together with her, and that is making things worse. The only reason I like her in the first place is because she said she liked me, and I slowly liked her more. My life really does just suck sometimes, but maybe things will get better. Another issue is that she keeps texting me, and then I respond, which is making things worse. So, I'm going to start shrinking my responses so that maybe she will lay off, which will help me move on and realize how dumb this whole thing is.

But I feel like she acknowledges the age gap because she brought up, kind of out of pocket, that her parents were ten years apart, and her mom was 22 while her dad was 32, which is really bad. So, I feel like it can't be that bad if I end up with her, and maybe I'll try. But at this point in time, I have no idea what to do. I am considering just being forward and asking if she invited me to prom because she liked me or as a friend. That would put everything to bed, but we need to be alone for that to happen.

I feel bad for whoever has to read this. It's probably somewhat entertaining but also really uncomfortable. I would hate reading someone else's life problems, but here I am forcing someone to read mine. Though depending on when this is graded, I will have solved this problem as I will be working with her for June and July at a BSA camp where we will have a little too much alone time."
0,"Today is May 4, 2022, and that means that prom is exactly three days away. I am so excited to go to prom this year with my friends because it is our senior year, and we are going to have the most fun we've ever had. It is going to be an exciting chain of events for us. That day is also my mom's birthday, which will make the day just that much more exciting.

The most exciting part of prom is probably the getting ready aspect of it. The excitement that you feel in the pit of your stomach as you're applying your makeup and curling your hair. It is just so riveting to see yourself all dressed up for an event that you've literally been waiting all year for. Then, going out to dinner before with your group and taking pictures in your amazing outfits is always a treat. After you eat, the drive to the prom is always so much fun because you blast the music and have a little burst of energy before you get into a room full of hundreds of people dancing and screaming and just overall going wild. It is so fun to see everyone getting out of their comfort zones for one night to dance and have fun with each other.

This year, I am most excited because of my prom group. My best friends, Kasish, Caroline, and I invited one of our school friends, Ruben, to come to prom with us. Everyone is talking about how he is either going to look like a player going to prom with three girls or he'll look like a loser just sitting in the corner holding our bags. I think we can make him look good. I'm also excited just to get ready because my dress this year is literally the most stunning thing I have ever seen. It is black, my favorite color, and ever since I've lost the weight I tried so hard to get rid of, my body looks incredible in that freaking dress. It is just so amazing, and I can't wait to wear it. I think it's going to be a showstopper for sure.

This year is just going to be magical. I can feel it in my bones."
0,"Literary elements stalk us in our daily routines. With that being said, I believe that traditional schooling is ridiculous, and that a new system of education must be adopted in the near future in order to maintain our current society. The idea of going to a building and sitting down to learn a specific thing was something adopted in the industrial revolution to get more factory workers. That idea of education has seeped into our schools and colleges. Let's not even start about the prices of higher education nowadays. I mean, $30k a year to go to school? That's insane. That's almost what the average American makes in a single year, all going towards ""bettering yourself."" All just to get a piece of paper that says you're qualified for a job, when you learn the majority of your skills in the job itself rather than in the classroom environment. Then, unless daddy pays for this very expensive piece of paper, you'll be paying off student loans until you're 40 years old, meaning you spent the last 20 years or so learning, paying off, and stressing over something that just gives you the ability to get your feet wet. Absolutely not, no thank you. Eldon will be working for a better future for his fellow man instead of slaving himself to the current system in place."
0,"Okay, so there's this boy I like, which is actually crazy because no one knows I like men. Yep, I'm a closeted gay guy here. So congratulations, AP grader person! You're the first to find out. Anyways, let's name this person... Johnny. Johnny and I became acquainted with each other at the beginning of this year. I've known him since 8th grade, but we have never spoken until now. It all started when my friend group merged with his friend group because my friend was also dating his friend. We would party together, and of course, drink. 

Johnny does this thing where he would come up to me and flirt, both of us being drunk, of course. I don't know if his behavior is just bro behavior or if he's really just curious. His flirting is very obvious, physically obvious if you know what I mean ;). This has been happening throughout the year, and in the past few months, him and I have gotten closer. Now, he works at my job, and I literally see him all the time. 

Last night, after work, he took me to Sonic, and we literally sat there and talked for hours. He is so handsome, and he's just good to talk to. But I can't say anything, or else I will out myself, and then everyone would know."
0,"I feel like when a character feels out of place, it is when they think they aren't someone they feel like themselves at times. They tend to feel like they don't like themselves, lacking self-love. This can be hard for some people because they think that others don't care about them or they feel like an outsider. They want to be someone they aren't supposed to be, and it's very difficult to see that. They often compare themselves to others, believing they can't do something that another person can do. They don't push themselves to do better and always have a negative outlook on their abilities. They fail to see that they can accomplish big things just like others can. It's really hard to see people struggle with this because they always have questions about how they can become better.

Sometimes, people are out of place when they have conversations with others and they go out of line, saying things that are inappropriate or out of place. People can be too self-centered, not realizing that their negative energy affects those around them. This negativity only leads to self-hatred and doesn't take anyone anywhere positive."
0,"This is my last essay to write, and my last AP test that I will ever take. So honestly, I am not going to write this one so that I have something to remember these two AP weeks by. I will talk about the book ""Jane Eyre"" because I read it freshman year and I actually really did enjoy it. I found that throughout my high school years, this book stuck with me the most, along with F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"". It is also another one of my beloved favorite books and movies of all time, especially the most recent one with Leonardo DiCaprio, of course. I hope you agree.

Just realizing, I don't know if you get paid to read these or not, but I am so sorry. You can stop reading now because honestly, I don't know what this brain word blabber will turn into in the next few lines or paragraphs."
0,"As we approach the Brillouin Zone at hyperspeed, I recollect myself. I see a moderate female counterpart, and I have no choice but to play Frank Sinatra. Compared to my other Human Centered Engineering counterparts, some consider me a wild man. I believe this type of experience is rather immersive. My fight or flight instincts, or Spidey sense, are suddenly triggered. I think I see the Green Goblin, so I turn off my Xbox because my heist is not going well. I think it is time to play Elden Ring.

As I am traversing through my humble abode, I think I see a ghost. However, the cross-sectional area appears off. Oh no, here we go again. But I could not fear; I had to make a grilled cheese sandwich. It was kind of mid, but I would never tell. I especially could not tell my BC Calc teacher."
0,"Well, I used to wake up in the morning before the rooster crowed, searching for soda bottles to collect some money. I would take them down to the corner and then to the country store to cash them in. I would give the money to a man named Curtis Lowe.

Old Curt was a black man with white, curly hair. He didn't have a care in the world when he had his fifth of wine. He used to only know one rope on his guitar and would play it across his knee. Whenever I gave old Curt his money, he would play for me all day long.

""Play me a song, Curtis Lowe, Curtis Lowe. I've got your drinking money, so tune up your banjo."" People used to say that he was useless, but those people were all fools. Curtis was the finest picker to ever play the blues.

Curtis Lowe had a talent that couldn't be denied. He could make that guitar sing like no one else. His fingers danced across the strings, creating melodies that touched the soul. His music had a way of reaching deep inside and stirring emotions that were buried within.

Listening to Curtis play was like being transported to another world. His bluesy tunes had a way of capturing the essence of life's struggles and triumphs. He could make you feel the pain and heartache, but also the joy and hope that comes with overcoming adversity.

Despite what others may have thought, Curtis Lowe was a true artist. He may not have had much in terms of material possessions, but he had a gift that was priceless. His music brought people together and touched their hearts in ways that words alone could never do.

So, let us not judge a book by its cover. Let us not dismiss someone based on appearances or preconceived notions. Curtis Lowe taught us that true talent knows no boundaries. It can be found in the most unexpected places and in the most unlikely individuals.

As I reflect on those days of searching for soda bottles and listening to Curtis play, I am reminded of the power of music. It has the ability to transcend barriers and unite people from all walks of life. It is a universal language that speaks to the soul and connects us on a deeper level.

So, let us celebrate the Curtis Lowes of the world. Let us appreciate their unique talents and the beauty they bring into our lives. And let us never underestimate the power of music to heal, inspire, and bring joy to our hearts."
1,"In The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nick, the recently new homeowner next to Gatsby, feels out of place when invited to the party. He is the only one with an invitation, while everyone else comes uninvited. When Gatsby and Daisy meet for the first time all over again, Nick has no clue what to do or where to go since Gatsby said he needed him there with him for support. Throughout the entire book, Nick is just an oddly placed character, following the adventures of the love story and sharing with the readers what is happening.

During the first week of Nick living next to Gatsby, he sees a big house party but wonders what is happening. This continues every week, with the parties getting larger and larger. Still confused, Nick has yet to meet Gatsby as he has not seen him around the area, except for one time when he was just a figure that disappeared in the night. Once Gatsby invites Nick to the party, Nick realizes he is the only one with an invitation and considers leaving since he feels out of place. However, he decides to stay and have a couple of drinks. The couple of drinks turn into a lot of drinks, and he now feels like the life of the party as he dances around, continuing his search for Gatsby.

He finds a ""helper"" at the party and starts talking down on Gatsby, saying a lot of bad things about him that he has heard as rumors. It is a surprising shock to Nick when he finds out that the man he was talking to was The Great Gatsby himself, and that was their first-time introduction. Gatsby is a kind and forgiving man who does not hold grudges, so he easily forgives Nick for the hurtful comments.

Secondly, Daisy, who is Nick's cousin, is revealed to be Gatsby's long-time lover whom he has not seen in years. Nick tries to reunite them for the sake of Gatsby's sanity. Gatsby has known where she lived and built a house directly across the water from her, patiently waiting for her to come to one of the parties he hosts. So Nick invites Daisy over to his house without her knowing that Gatsby is also there, waiting for her arrival. Once Daisy arrives, it is very silent, and Nick tries to leave to let them talk alone. However, Gatsby pulls him back into the house, asking him to stay since he cannot do it alone. Throughout their conversation, Nick just stands in the corner, waiting for them to need him or say something to him.

The character of Nick plays a crucial role in the story but also does not speak barely at all unless he is drunk or asked questions. He is just used as a telephone to hear what they have said and to provide us with what they have said. This happens throughout the book, such as in car rides, when Tom takes Nick out to get drinks on his birthday, and when they made Daisy choose which lover she wanted. The only time he was viewed as included was when Gatsby died, and no one would help with the funeral planning or payments. Nick tries to do everything he can since he knows that there was really no one else who knew Gatsby like he did. Nick does not share his feelings of exclusion, but it is shown in parts. We all know Nick loved Gatsby and he provided so much to him, doing whatever they could for each other. However, when Gatsby was with Daisy, it was as if Nick did not exist around her.

During the heatwave when everyone was in the room together, including Nick, Gatsby brings up the fact that Daisy never loved Tom. At this point, Nick once again tries to leave since he feels uncomfortable, but he is not able to. They do not let him leave, and they continue to have a huge fight. Nick is just in the corner, listening to the argument as it happens. Once they finish arguing, Gatsby takes Daisy and leaves Nick there with Tom. Tom sees Nick after the fight and offers him a drink, which Nick accepts since he remembers it is his birthday.

At the end of the book, we read that Nick is talking with someone about the past. It is not realized until later that he was telling this man all the things that happened to him, and we were along with that man, just hearing what was happening as well. The stories continuously run through Nick's head as he loved that part of his life. He had fun and was happy until the death of Gatsby, which devastated everyone close to him, like Nick. Firstly, Daisy didn't come, and secondly, no one who went to his parties attended the funeral since they didn't know him, only his parties."
1,"Well, usually when someone feels out of place, it doesn't mean it's their fault. It just means that they are with the wrong people. We live in a society where we blame ourselves for not being like other people and for not doing the things that they do. But in reality, we just have to be ourselves and find the right people who won't make us feel out of place.

I'll give myself as an example. I am an 18-year-old male who is a senior in high school. I don't drink, party, or go to parties. I don't want to go to prom or even go to graduation. To top it all off, I am loyal to my God because I am Christian. However, we live in a society where people below my age think that vaping, drinking, smoking, and partying are normal and ""living life."" But that isn't living life for me because I am not like them.

So, going to school for 180 days and feeling left out sucks. I come to school and I can't relate to anyone because they all drink and like to party, etc. We also have people thinking that there are more than two genders and who think abortion is okay. I just don't agree, and I don't like to align myself with those types of people.

With time, I've come to conclude that I am different and I need to be with people who are like me. I'm not going to cry over someone's opinion because they don't like me. I couldn't care less if anyone likes me. I just want to be with the right people who I know will be my friend and be by my side.

I'm not saying society is the problem. All I'm saying is that I just don't fit in, and I'm not the problem. Nor should I change who I am. I just need to be with the right people, and that's okay. I know we are all different, and I know not everyone has my mature mindset. But if not shared or expressed, being in the wrong crowd can really change and hurt people.

Parents don't take the time to teach their kids to be themselves anymore. Because now, being gay is cool, or vaping is cool, or drinking is cool. Just for the feeling of being included, people change who they are to fit in because before they didn't.

So anyway, now that that is over, let me tell you my plans. Basically, after I leave this boring school, I get to go home early, maybe. I don't know yet if I'm going to make pasta with ground meat because I really want some. But I also have Chinese food that I did not finish. Now that I think about it, I don't really like Chinese food like that anymore. Maybe a wonton soup and definitely the dumplings because those are fire. But yeah, I also don't have much time to cook if I was to make pasta with ground meat because I have a soccer game to watch. Well, my dad is supposed to watch it, but who knows, you know? But if he is going to pick me up, then I won't make any food, and he and I will most likely buy something to eat and watch the glorious semi-final against Manchester City. I really hope they win.

Tomorrow is another busy day for me because I have to study my character for a criminal justice project. After that, I also have some music I have to learn for Teen Arts. Then I have band and jazz band rehearsal afterwards at 3 pm at school. So, I have to go home, change, and come back. Then I have to go to church, and then I finally get to watch Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which I have been waiting so long to do. So, I can't wait, but it is a busy day. Wish me luck for tomorrow's success, and also that Real Madrid win today. Peace out, have a great day."
1,"In the Scarlet Letter, we are approached right into Hester's life. Hester was not only such a brave woman who had to go through such difficult obstacles in life, but alongside her, Dimmesdale had to undergo so much guilt. Both characters demonstrated the feeling of being out of place. For Dimmesdale, he did feel in place; however, deep down, he knows he is out of place. We get both ideas of characters who are unwanted, one of himself and the other being physically not wanted.

Everyone in the village would idolize Dimmesdale and see him as someone who is innocent and pure. Along with that, both Hester and Dimmesdale had to go through such difficult moments in the novel. Hester had to deal with name-calling, having herself isolate herself away from the village really affected her since she had no support but herself. Her cottage, which was her home, was the only location where she would feel safe as an independent mother. This place was the only way for her to get out of all the negativity that is mentioned to her from the sins she committed. Not only did it affect Hester, but also her daughter. Once her daughter had grown around the age of 7, children around the village didn't like her presence revolving around them. It did affect them overall, them being present in the village. The young girl had no issue; she wasn't the problem, and they still wouldn't like her being there.

Dimmesdale, on the other hand, felt out of place since he knows that he has committed a sin. He knows that he doesn't belong there; his position as a religious man should not continue. Him seeing Hester struggling at one point really made him aware of how he shouldn't keep up with the ways they are. All the secrecy that he had was eating him. Towards the end of this novel, we get to a point where Dimmesdale had enough; he had to tell the truth due to Chillingworth's interference in both Hester and Dimmesdale's lives, which really affected his health. He sacrificed himself to tell the truth to the whole village. He brought himself, his loved ones Hester and his daughter, that he was the cause of Hester's sins. He even had the ""A"" on his chest symbolizing the ""A"" that Hester had all along. We really get this idea that being unwanted really conflicts with the others that they revolve with, affecting them too all along.

Overall, Hester was quite a strong woman, having to deal with all this conflict that she had to deal with, not having anyone in the beginning but her daughter. However, towards the end, thanks to Dimmesdale, she felt comfort and fell into place since he had everyone know the real truth."
1,"In the novel The Giver, the author uses literary devices to show how the main character breaks social norms to do what he feels is right. Through the use of imagery, we are presented with a colorless Utopian society where everyone is considered ""Equal.""

In this society, once the children reach a certain age, they are all assigned certain jobs in society to carry out. The main character, a teenage boy around 13, is assigned the job of receiver of memories. This is the most prestigious job in the society and is only given to the person who is deemed to be the most responsible. The receiver of memories is the only one in the society with knowledge about real-life events that have taken place, such as wars, famines, genocides, etc. Everyone else in society doesn't know anything that doesn't fit the vision. To keep everyone equal, everyone but the receiver is also deprived of the ability to see color, as to not see race.

We are told that the previous girl who was given this honor ran away past the bounds of the city because she was unable to cope with the trauma, which released the memories she had into society, causing a great deal of pain to the people. The boy has many questions but starts the process of receiving the memories well.

When someone makes a mistake in the society, they are released. The general population doesn't know what that means, only to avoid it. The receiver, however, is taught that it's the equivalent of being executed. This is when he starts to waver as he comes to the realization of all the deaths taking place around him.

His turning point comes when his father, who works in a nursery, is tasked with observing a child named Gabriel. If Gabriel doesn't show signs of developing on par with his age, he is supposed to be released. Unable to let this happen, the main character develops a plan to accelerate the pace at which he is keeping track of the memories and run away with Gabriel to release all the memories to the population, in hopes that they realize that he did the right thing.

The author of the book is also trying to teach the readers a lesson that authoritarian societies do not work and that it is dangerous to heavily censor information. People should mostly be free to make their own decisions and decide right from wrong. The absence of accountability has and will create dangerous situations where people will die."
1,"In ""Fahrenheit 451"" by Ray Bradbury, as he realizes how wrong the world has become because of their mass censorship, Guy Montag goes against society in order to preserve books and knowledge.

Montag's role in society at the beginning of the book was a fireman who burned houses that illegally kept books. When Montag saw the woman whose house he was supposed to burn for keeping books burn herself alive along with her books, that was the catalyst for him to wonder what was so precious about books that someone would willingly burn themselves with it. He questioned his job as a fireman and questioned if what he was doing was right or wrong.

His curiosity led him to do something a fireman in this novel should never do - keep a book and read it. Even though he didn't quite understand what the words between the pages meant at first, he knew they meant something important which is why he continued to read them and continued to try sharing it with others. He read to his wife, Mildred, and her friends, but they did not seem to understand it either, or if they did, they started crying.

Although Mildred claimed that because her friend was crying from the reading that it was inappropriate, Montag knew that she understood those words, and those words had formed into a piece of art, and that art can be emotional. To Montag, his reading aloud was a success, even if Mildred's friends never came back. He understood that he couldn't change society as a whole overnight, but he did do smaller things like burning the chief of the fire department, hiding books in other firemen's houses, having someone print copies of books to distribute to the world, and even considered burning down the fire department itself. He even memorized a book before having it get burned and ran off to share his newfound knowledge with others and to pass it to the next generation.

He wanted the world that killed others for joy and only cared about having fun to realize that there are so many more things to appreciate like dandelions, grass blades, rain, and of course, the act of knowing, and Montag believed that the key to knowing was inside books."
1,"In Things Fall Apart, written by Chinua Achebe, Ikemefuna, the son of the main character, feels very out of place within his culture and family. When missionaries arrive in his village, attempting to spread their religion, Ikemefuna becomes interested in hearing what they have to say. The only time his father interacts with him is through violence, except for when Ikemefuna pretends to be interested in fighting just to have a conversation where his father shows him something other than violence. However, when seeking information about the word of Christ, Ikemefuna is treated kindly and not forced to convert or pretend to be something he is not in order to receive kindness. The missionaries want him to convert on his own and assure him that they will understand his decision. This captures Ikemefuna's attention because it references a Father full of love who does not dictate the only correct way to be a man.

Unfortunately, Ikemefuna's father is not pleased with his interest in the new religion and ultimately disowns him for not following his father's expectations. With the spread of this new religion, Ikemefuna takes it upon himself to share it with his mother and others in their village, and he helps the missionaries in spreading the word of Christ. As more and more people become interested in this new religion, Ikemefuna's father feels that he no longer has control over his village and sees suicide as the only solution. Ikemefuna, on the other hand, is happy at the thought of his father's wives and children finally being free from his abusive behavior. He plans to live his life the way he wants, no longer under the influence of his father, with the help of this new religion being spread in their village.

If Ikemefuna's father had not harbored such a strong hatred for his son, who he deemed not manly enough, they could have had a healthy relationship and saved him from feeling so out of control that suicide seemed necessary."
1,"In 1984, the main character Winston often views society as something he has never been a part of. He is constantly going against what the government believes. The government believes in having absolutely no thoughts or feelings and they want complete dominance over society.

In the beginning of the story, Winston even starts writing in his journal, expressing himself and how he feels towards the government. He openly admits that he hates Big Brother, knowing that what he is doing is considered bad. Even when Winston goes to help his neighbors fix something, the children make him uncomfortable by shouting ""go Big Brother"" or expressing their desire to witness someone's death, instead of wanting to play with other kids. This behavior is considered normal for them because they have been conditioned to love Big Brother and praise him. Winston, on the other hand, does not engage in these activities as much as others do. He does not show love for Big Brother, which makes him abnormal or out of place.

Towards the end of the book, we can see the Party's complete power and victory. Winston finds himself in the Ministry of Love and sees Mr. Charrington there as well. Mr. Charrington is only there because his own daughter reported him to the thought police for sleep talking and saying negative things about Big Brother. Surprisingly, Mr. Charrington does not feel sorry for his actions. Instead, he thanks his daughter for reporting him and believes that there is something wrong with him. This is when one starts to realize that the Party truly has complete power, as people are made to feel guilty or sorry for having thoughts they cannot control.

In conclusion, Winston's perspective on society in 1984 is one of alienation and opposition to the government's beliefs. He does not conform to the norms of loving Big Brother and praising the Party. As the story progresses, it becomes evident that the Party has complete control and power over individuals' thoughts and actions. The fear and guilt instilled in people for having independent thoughts is a testament to the Party's dominance."
1,"In the novel Frankenstein, it tells the story of a mad scientist who creates a monster using various human body parts. However, upon creating the creature, the scientist immediately regrets his decision. The creature is nameless, often referred to as either ""monster"" or ""creature"". Frankenstein, the scientist, had the intention of creating the creature. The results of his experiment were a strong, large, and horrifying monster. In an attempt to rid himself of the creature, Frankenstein kicks him out of his laboratory.

As the creature ventures into the world, he stumbles upon a village filled with people. Unfortunately, upon approaching them, he is met with fear and hostility. The villagers brandish pitchforks and torches, wanting to chase him away. This rejection leaves the creature feeling like an outcast, alone and unwanted. He eventually finds solace in a small shed next to a home, where he hides and lives in secrecy. Although people already inhabit the home, the creature refrains from revealing himself, aware of the consequences that would follow.

During his time in hiding, the creature learns to speak, read, and understand human society and history through observing the villagers. The more he learns, the more he becomes aware of his own hideous appearance and his position as an outcast. This realization sparks a desire within him to no longer be alone. He threatens Frankenstein, demanding that he create a mate for him, or else he will kill Frankenstein's wife and loved ones. However, Frankenstein fears the consequences of the creature reproducing and decides to destroy the progress of the experiment. This decision infuriates the creature, who then vows to kill Frankenstein's wife.

Overall, the novel Frankenstein explores the themes of isolation, rejection, and the consequences of playing god. The creature's longing for companionship and his anger towards Frankenstein drive the narrative forward, creating a tale of tragedy and despair."
1,"In the novel ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" the author demonstrates Huck Finn's feeling of being out of place by using imagery to describe the environment that he is in. Huck lived on a farm in the middle of the South. His family was very strict and required their children to work on the farm with the slaves. Now, Huck had it better than the slaves, but it was still not easy for him.

Huck hated his home and wanted to run away, but he could not do it by himself. After a few years, his family captured a runaway slave named Tom and locked him in their shed. Huck finally saw his chance, but instead of opening the shed and letting him out, he wanted to plan a more adventurous escape plan. So, he dug a tunnel underneath the wall of the shed. When they had completed their tunnel, they made a run for it, and Huck ended up being shot in the leg.

At this point, Huck didn't know what to do because he didn't want to go home to his family. However, if he stayed out in the woods, he would not survive from the brutal leg injury. To Huck's surprise, Tom was thankful and cared about Huck. Tom knew some medical skills and was able to help Huck with his injury. This sparked a new fire within little Huck because he had never felt like anyone had ever cared about him until that night. They ended up continuing their escape and becoming best friends.

So now, it was set in Huck's mind that he didn't just want to help Tom escape, but stay with him for a while because of the friendship they had and the way it made him feel. There was no more harshness and cruelty from being out of place at home. Simply put, Huck felt like he was in paradise. From there on, Tom and Huck's adventures continued."
1,"When a character feels out of place, they lose the ability to blend in well, and their perception becomes warped. This can lead to communication problems, as they may not share common interests with others. Interactions can become awkward, with the protagonist misinterpreting words or actions as hostile. The protagonist's thinking process and flaws are highlighted, providing insight for the reader. Feeling out of place is an unpleasant experience, and the protagonist may even create their own downfall due to their discomfort. This may seem unreasonable to some, but it is based on a certain truth. When someone is uncomfortable, they may sacrifice their own future just to avoid making others feel the same way. Their perception of reality differs greatly from others, and this contrast can be exploited by introducing a more outgoing character, creating tension or allowing for the growth of the shy character. Additionally, a character feeling out of touch may be a result of past trauma, further deepening the reader's understanding and connection with them. This sense of displacement can also lead to conflicts with other characters, driving the plot forward as the character seeks to communicate, silence themselves, or resolve the problems they have created. While a character like this can contribute to the story, they may not always receive sympathy from the readers."
2,"Essay: Feeling Out of Place and Its Impact on Decision-Making

There are many real-life scenarios where people feel out of place. In fact, it has become the norm for some individuals. In the novel ""Firefly Lane,"" Tallulah Hart experiences a profound sense of being out of place. Living with a mother who is constantly high and neglectful, Tallulah feels disconnected from her surroundings. This feeling intensifies as she compares her imperfect life to her best friend Kate's seemingly perfect family and life. Consequently, Tallulah's sense of being out of place influences her decision-making, leading her to make questionable choices.

One significant consequence of Tallulah feeling out of place is her tendency to lie. Embarrassed by her mother's behavior, Tallulah fabricates a story to Kate, claiming that she has cancer. This decision contributes to the overall interpretation of the story, as it allows the audience to relate to the characters. Everyone has experienced the temptation to lie at some point in their lives and understands the guilt that accompanies it. Likewise, being lied to is a universal experience. The author skillfully engages the reader by depicting how Tallulah navigates the web of lies she has spun, highlighting the consequences of her actions. Tallulah's decision to lie stems from her feeling out of place in her friendship with Kate.

Another questionable decision made by Tallulah due to her sense of being out of place is her participation in underage parties during high school. Desperate to fit in and be like everyone else, Tallulah knowingly makes the wrong choice. This decision contributes to the overall interpretation of the story by revealing the depth of Tallulah's emotional pain. Feeling so out of place, she resorts to making decisions she knows are wrong, simply to feel ""normal"" like her peers. This demonstrates the extent of her hurt and her longing to belong.

Furthermore, Tallulah's feeling of being out of place leads her to become involved with the wrong person in college. She engages in a relationship with her professor, a decision that proves to be disastrous. Even in college, Tallulah cannot shake off the feeling of being out of place. Her disregard for rules stems from her deep-rooted sense of not belonging. Frustrated and angry with the world, she becomes willing to do anything to feel something. This decision contributes to the overall interpretation of the story by showcasing Tallulah's desperation to find satisfaction. Feeling out of place wherever she goes, she yearns to belong somewhere.

In conclusion, Tallulah's questionable decisions are a direct result of her feeling out of place. She lies to her best friend, attends parties in high school, and becomes involved with her college professor. Tallulah's actions stem from her desire to feel welcomed and accepted. If she did not feel out of place in the world, she would not have made these poor decisions. The reasoning behind her actions lies in her longing to belong and feel a sense of purpose."
2,"In the novel series ""Percy Jackson,"" written by Rick Riordian, many of the main characters experience a feeling of being out of place. The premise of the novel series is that the main characters are demigods, or the children of deities (In the case of the novel, either Greek or Roman deities). Because these children have a parent that is quite literally a god, during the normal times of their life, they often feel out of place within normal society.

In the first novel, ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief,"" it is explained that one of the many reasons that these characters feel out of place is because their brains are wired to function differently from regular humans. Nico is a character that has felt out of place his whole life. Being the son of Hades, god of death and of the underworld, Nico has certain powers that initially left him unable to function within normal society. This concept that Nico is unable to fit into normal society not only affects the character but also has an influence on the interpretation of the Percy Jackson series as a whole.

Nico, unable to fit into society, had spent his whole life running. When he eventually ran into the safe haven for demigods like him, he still was out of place. He could not control the powers that hurt those around him. Even in a setting in which he was supposed to feel at home, Nico could not do to the power that was out of his control. This left Nico feeling isolated from the people who were supposed to be his friends, as he couldn't relate to them. Unlike most of the demigods, Nico had not been raised like a normal human. Nico spent his life running away. Not only could Nico not relate to the other demigods because he lacked life experiences similar to them, but he was also isolated due to the fact that he couldn't necessarily be around them given his power could potentially harm them unintentionally. Nico was the lone wolf, and as a result, remained isolated and generally would always feel out of place.

In the midst of the Percy Jackson series, Nico is representative of the damages isolation and egocentrism can cause. The general centralized theme established throughout the Percy Jackson series was that teamwork can make even impossible things possible and that friendship can help one reach their potential. Nico represents the challenges that can come across and compromise a goal. Nico's personality and actions all ultimately boil down to the core concept that isolationism can inhibit goals and having a negative mindset (such as constantly believing one is out of place) can lead to these detrimental factors in inhibiting one's potential.

All in all, Nico, one of the main characters in the Percy Jackson series, is the outlier within the group of main characters. He constantly feels out of place, metaphorically representing isolationism and its impact, and as a result, contributes towards the work by demonstrating the negative impacts that isolationism can have on achieving goals."
2,"In Harry Potter, book number 1, Harry is a character who has always felt out of place. Harry has always been a misplaced person and has never felt like he belonged. He is an orphan whose parents died in a car accident, which is what he was told for most of his life. He is forced to live with his aunt, uncle, and cousin. They mistreat Harry very poorly and don't treat him like family. He always feels out of place and never feels welcomed or like he is a part of the family. He even feels misplaced when he is around other kids. He never feels like he is in a good place and is always thinking about why he is out of place. They don't even give Harry gifts for Christmas, and his birthday is like it doesn't exist.

He also realizes that as he gets older, his brain works differently and he can do things that he never imagined he would be able to do. One day, he goes to the zoo and realizes that he can talk to snakes because he can understand what the snake is saying to him. They start to have a conversation, and his uncle realizes that he is talking to a snake. His uncle looks at him like he's a freak and even calls him a freak. Harry then discovers that the reason why he feels out of place so much and can never fit in with normal human kids is because he isn't a normal human kid - Harry is a wizard.

Harry being a wizard makes him realize why he has always felt like he doesn't belong and is out of place. He also connects the reason why his aunt and uncle didn't like him because they knew that he was a wizard by blood since his two parents were wizards before they died. He felt so out of place because he wasn't human but a wizard with a mind of a wizard who could talk to snakes. In a way, when Harry finds this out, we can see throughout the story how the character's life and emotions change.

He is sent off to a school meant for wizard kids like him to study and express their wizard genes and blood without being judged by other humans and being called ""freaks"". Harry meets his best friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, when he goes to Hogwarts. They teach Harry the value of love and friendship, and for the first time in his life, Harry feels at home and in place. Harry finds the place where he won't be judged because he is different, but he can express his true self.

We see Harry as he grows up throughout the books and how he changes as a human being. He starts to feel more welcomed in life and finally feels included, not mistreated like his aunt and uncle would mistreat him. Harry feeling out of place gave him a sense of hopelessness and feeling unworthy of being able to do anything with his life because all his aunt and uncle would tell him was that he was nothing and didn't belong in their family. We see the character grow from that and the transformation from not feeling like he belongs and is in the right place to feeling belonged and finally having that feeling that he is home, belongs, and is worthy of something in life."
2,"In the book ""Pride and Prejudice,"" it is revealed that when a character feels out of place, they are destined to make their own future and disrupt many of the prominent societal standards.

Feeling out of place is oftentimes an indication that you have different desires than those around you, which in turn leads to a unique future. In the book ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Jane Austen plants a hopeless romantic, Elizabeth Bennett, into a society that values marrying for title, status, and wealth. Elizabeth witnesses those around her crave these aspects of life in hopes of supporting themselves and their families. Elizabeth tries to avoid this scene yet is dragged in by her sister Jane, who hopes to win over a wealthy man. Thankfully, Elizabeth is soon able to find true love with a man named Mr. Darcy and winds up creating her own life. Mr. Darcy is very wealthy, yet Elizabeth's interest sprouts from her love for him and nothing else. Thus, Elizabeth was able to create her own unique future as she let her differences guide her and didn't conform to those around. Overall, those who feel out of place may create their own destiny and future as they are led by their unique nature.

Oftentimes, when one strays from the intended path of life, they may disrupt societal standards and influence those around them. For many, it is hard to accept the success of others when it comes in an unconventional way; however, others may take it as inspiration. Thus, a divide may be created between what society deems to be acceptable and a disruption of societal standards is formed. In ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Elizabeth's unconventional way of winning over Mr. Darcy was frowned upon by many. Although she was the one with pure intentions, it was foreign for somebody to not crave titles, status, and wealth. Thus, Elizabeth's success in gaining this by merely being herself created envy. Envy and resentment were one opinion towards her love; however, acceptance was another. Some people, especially those close to Elizabeth, looked at her to be an inspiration. She proved that love is enough and it should be prioritized above greed. She created a divide in society and disrupted societal standards because of the feeling that she was out of place. Overall, characters who feel out of place have the capability to create their own unique future and change society around them."
2,"Generally, plenty of main characters in works of fiction have internal conflicts which drive the plot. These conflicts can range from the main character fighting against themselves, their friends and family, society, the opposite gender, etc. In ""The Bell Jar,"" the main character's hardest conflict is the battle she faces within herself. Despite having a good internship, good grades, and a supportive family, she still feels out of place. She continues to feel worse and feels confusion but accepts the downfall. This then leads into a long spiral of depression and derealization of her own life. She does not reach out for help when she begins to feel out of place in the world. She isolates herself and stops taking care of herself or anything having to do with her life's achievements. She is essentially consumed by her feelings of doubt in herself. She gives up hope. Her experiences go to show how much of a toll it can take on an individual when their inner self feels like they do not belong.

After she stops believing in her own capabilities, she moves home and stays with her mother. She finds living dreadful, and it is further exemplified when she moves back home. She harbors feelings of inferiority and lack of interest in her life. She simply wishes to be gone. After a suicide attempt, she is admitted to a psych ward. Her experiences in the psych ward definitely helped her out of her spiral. She met people that made her feel less crazy, but her egotistical and depressive outlooks on life stopped her from developing any actual human relationships, whether romantic or not. She feels that her own sadness is above that of anybody else. However, when one of her acquaintances takes her own life, a major life motion is set into place. We never fully know the outcome of the main character's life, whether or not she is successfully recovered and out of the hospital. However, we know she is left feeling optimistic about life, which she lacked beforehand.

Many people relate to the content in ""The Bell Jar"" because it is very closely related to the life of its author, Sylvia Plath, who took her own life after a long battle with mental illness. The story of ""The Bell Jar"" is interpreted as a feminist novel that touches on the matter of mental health and the lengths we can go to as humans when we simply do not feel like our place in the world is secure."
2,"In Shakespeare's play, ""Hamlet,"" the story revolves around a prince named Hamlet who falls in love with his own niece and seeks revenge for his father's death by killing his uncle. However, the erratic behavior of Hamlet, the main character, feels out of place in the context of the dialogue and setting of the play. Hamlet can be described as a madman who constantly exaggerates things and engages in questionable actions, both in the eyes of modern-day readers and the audiences of the time when the play was first released.

Hamlet does not fit the mold of a charming prince that one might read about in a children's book. Firstly, he falls in love with Ophelia, his niece and the daughter of the current king of Denmark, who was responsible for killing Hamlet's father, the former king, and marrying Hamlet's mother. This complicated relationship adds to the unconventional nature of the story.

Furthermore, Hamlet's erratic behavior seems disconnected from the main plot. Instead of rallying support and seeking revenge against the king, he becomes infatuated with Ophelia and attempts to embarrass the king by staging a play for the nobles. This action not only puts Hamlet in a position of being looked down upon but also drives Ophelia to madness when she learns of it.

Some may argue that Hamlet's actions are justified due to the deep love he had for his father and the desire for revenge that anyone in his position would feel. However, even considering this, Hamlet's behavior is abnormal within the context of his noble upbringing and seems out of place in a class known for its fancy and luxurious lifestyle.

Nevertheless, the wealthy elite class can also be known for their dramatic tendencies, often crying over trivial matters or the loss of a loved one. Regular people may view such behavior as excessive, but for the elite, it is considered a way of life. In this story, Hamlet is the first character to demonstrate madness to the audience, but he is not the first to take psychopathic actions, unlike the king of Denmark, who is the brother of Hamlet's father.

In conclusion, Hamlet's character in Shakespeare's play is portrayed as a madman whose actions and behavior feel out of place within the context of the story. His unconventional love for his niece and his erratic nature make him stand out among the noble class known for their lavish lifestyle. While some may argue that his actions are justified due to his father's death, Hamlet's behavior remains abnormal and does not align with the expectations of a prince."
2,"In the story ""Frankenstein,"" a scientist named Frankenstein faces the consequences of his actions after he creates a monster who feels socially rejected. With the intent of being a hero, handsome, strong, and manly, Frankenstein gathers organs and limbs of dead people from graves and creates a human in his science lab. However, what he intended was not reality. The monster he created had black teeth, was ugly, horrifying to the eyes, and violent.

Horrified, Frankenstein left the monster in his lab and continued to have a life of his own. However, later in the novel, we are shown the monster's true feelings and experiences. The monster conveys to his creator, Victor Frankenstein, that he feels neglected, and that is why he is wreaking havoc. The monster continues to say that humans look at him weirdly and no one will take him in, so he resorts to violence instead. The monster even threatens Victor's family and eventually kills many of his family members.

This neglect brought upon by Victor affects the monster not only in regards to violence but also in regards to the fact that because of this, the monster truly has no idea how to act around people and doesn't know right from wrong. For example, when the monster was observing the family to learn things from them, he eventually lit their house on fire. This is not necessarily because the monster hated the family, but because he was not taught what is right and what is wrong. He felt ignored and socially rejected when everyone got scared looking at him and his own owner disappeared in horror. This is why the monster resorts to violence and blackmail.

The monster ends up killing William, Victor's brother, after Victor disappears from his life. The monster then leaves hints in sneaky ways that it was him who killed Victor's brother and vows to be with Victor during his wedding day. All of this social rejection and neglect gave the monster his name.

In contrast, we would have seen a completely different story if Victor stuck with his creation and taught him what is right and wrong. This lack of neglect would make the monster feel cared for and shy him away from violence."
2,"In King Lear, one of the sisters, Cordelia, feels out of place. From the beginning of the play, it is obvious that King Lear has a plan for his daughters to all marry fairly young and then split his Kingdom as he grows old. Two out of the three sisters have husbands - Goneril and Regan are married - while Cordelia is not. When discussing family plans, it is obvious that the King has his intentions for his Kingdom and wants people to follow his way.

At the beginning of the play, the King decides that the way he will divvy out his land will be his daughters confessing their love for him. It is shown through the actions of the King that he wants to feel loved and needed because he has the power everyone needs to worship him. He wants his daughters to confess their love because he likes that powerful, gratifying feeling. Once Goneril and Regan tell the King what he wants to hear, so they can be rewarded, Cordelia explains how she doesn't like the ways of the King. She tells the family that she shouldn't have to marry someone she doesn't want to and own a third of the Kingdom. She explains that it shouldn't be necessary to confess love to her father to benefit from it.

The consequences of her actions resulted in her banishment from the Kingdom. This reveals how there is only one way to act under King Lear, and everyone else fits in, but there's no room for other opinions. She was banished because she went against the King. Cordelia stood up for herself and her morals, but because she wasn't being a follower and forcing herself to conform, she was banished. She did not fit in with the rest of her family because her other sisters were simply giving the King what he wanted - the gratification of feeling loved and powerful - for personal gain. Cordelia did not fit this conformity and went against the ways of the Kingdom, which consequently left her to be thrown out."
2,"In the Great Gatsby, the perspective of Nick constantly changes as the truths of the characters around him in West Egg are revealed with luxurious imagery, symbolism, and irony.

First, Nick meets with his cousin, Daisy, who introduces him to her husband, Tom, a rich and hard-headed man. Evidently, he cheats on her with a woman who makes him buy her new sets of clothes to wear almost every day to appear luxurious, despite not being well-off herself. These dysfunctional relationships and the clothes establish the facade that these people depict themselves as: Tom as a loyal husband and his mistress as rich. Nick, not being very well-off himself, does not associate himself with them very closely.

Throughout the story, we are shown various signs of a ""higher power"". This is through a billboard with the specifically blue eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleberg, which watch over the city. These reoccur as a symbol throughout the story to express how everyone is being scrutinized, whether it be by a theoretical higher power or in skepticism of each other. Nick never accustoms himself with the people of West Egg and finds himself a part of these watching eyes.

At the climax of the story, Gatsby is murdered at his home after a misunderstanding with Tom, as Gatsby tried to start an affair with his wife, Daisy. He's found dead in his pool, ironically despite always saying that he was afraid of swimming. The pool here represented the unknown, as he has always lived in luxury and comfort. However, this situation came since he took the chance in having a relationship with Daisy, which eventually got him killed.

Throughout the story, Nick encountered new people who seemed to get less genuine as time went by. He had the most fallouts with Gatsby. Even so, however, he recognized him as a genuine person. Gatsby's death marks the end of the story after Nick leaves in disgust."
2,"In the story ""The Scarlet Letter,"" which takes place a couple hundred years ago in the New World, a woman has an affair with a priest while her husband is away overseas. She ends up pregnant and is labeled with a scarlet colored ""A,"" standing for adulterer, on all of her clothes in order to make her stick out in a crowd and publicly shame her. Being branded with such a label was meant to bring sadness and guilt to the wearer and mock her for the mistakes she has made in her past.

During most of the story, the woman battles with feelings of being an outcast, all while trying to provide her new daughter with the best life she can muster. The woman's mental stability is affected tremendously, but she works hard to break out of her insecurity and leave an impactful mark on her daughter. A symbolic moment happens when the woman embroiders the letter on her clothes with gold thread and begins to embrace her differences, despite whatever people did or thought. She marches around the small town and parades her beautiful daughter to the people. Though she faces backlash, she wants her daughter to understand that being herself is okay, and differences don't make someone a bad person.

The story follows this theme and uses this plot, as well as the gold embroidered letter, to drive the idea home that standing out isn't a sin, and that readers should treat themselves and others with respect, even if they disagree with others' ideas and actions. This theme makes the story inspiring and relatable to most, since everyone has felt like an outcast at some point in life. ""The Scarlet Letter"" and the gold embroidered ""A"" emphasize the importance of accepting your own identity before attempting to persuade others to agree with yours."
3,"Many works of literature examine the experience of characters who feel out of place, whether that is within their family, their community, their culture, or their own body. In the novel, ""The Great Gatsby,"" the protagonist Nick Carraway experiences this feeling when he gains insight into the lives of the elite and rich people around him, causing him to flee and never want to be associated with those people ever again.

In the beginning of the novel, Nick is a very humble man who never judges people. He is not the richest but is quite well-off for the time period. He has just recently moved to the West Egg of town and comes across his neighbor, Gatsby, a man known for fitting into the stereotypes of the rich people during that time - always partying and drinking. Already, Nick does not feel too secure since he lives in a very tiny house near all of these huge mansions. But he decides to put that aside and becomes close with his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom.

Eventually, Gatsby becomes aware of Daisy and Nick being related, so he makes it his mission to befriend him to get close to Daisy, who is an ex-lover of his. Nick and Gatsby spend a lot of time together and Nick considers him to be a friend. Nick gives him advice on his obsession with Daisy and tells him, ""You can't bring back the past."" Gatsby dismisses Nick, making him feel as if he has no voice because of his economic and social status. Gatsby is of new money, so he doesn't really have a lot of respect when it comes to his status either. Daisy and Tom are of old money, which is the sole reason why Daisy didn't end up with Gatsby instead. It was a forbidden love.

Nick tries to get them together to see his friend happy, but it does not work out because Daisy cares too much about her reputation as an old-money woman. This is the breaking point for Nick because he starts to judge them. Another reason why he feels out of place is that he is going against his morals and values. Ever since he was a child, his father taught him to never judge people because you never know what they're going through in their lives, and Nick stood by that. But the people around him are what he hates most about people. They are selfish and do not really care about anyone or anything but their money and status.

Towards the end of the novel, Tom, Daisy, and Gatsby have a quarrel over Daisy and Gatsby's affair. Tom exposes the way Gatsby attained his new wealth and makes Daisy realize that being with a man like him will ruin her reputation. Nick, seemingly the irrelevant character of it all, just watches the relationships of everyone unravel before his eyes. Gatsby ends up being shot by the husband of Tom's mistress, believing that Gatsby was the one who ran her over, even though it was Daisy. Gatsby takes the blame to protect the woman he loves most, believing that, in return, she will leave Tom for him. Nick, devastated for his friend, gives him some more advice to flee the country and admits that Daisy is no good for him. Stubborn as he is, Gatsby decides to wait for Daisy to contact him, making Nick lose a friend over his cousin, who does not even have the courage to attend the funeral. Nick calls her multiple times to let her know what has happened, and she flees the country with Tom. Nick, disgusted and astonished, cannot believe that a person like her can just cover up her murder.

At the very end of the novel, Nick states that he will be leaving the West Egg for another side of New York. In summary, although Nick is not involved with all the drama going on in his life, he still gets the chance to view all of it with the point of view of a non-rich person. The author chose Nick to be the narrator of the book because he is the most unbiased and is the only one who can give the readers the most accurate information when it comes to the lives of the people around him. Nick does not care about his economic or social status as much as someone like Gatsby or Daisy, so the readers have a better insight into the dramatic lives of the elite at the time and comprehend how powerful money can be."
3,"Many works of literature feature a character that feels out of place or as if they do not fit in. One piece of literature that features this is The Death of a Salesman. Although many works of fiction feature a character that feels out of place, Death of a Salesman features Biff, who feels as if he is a failure and cannot make his father proud. Therefore, he feels out of place within not only the world but his family as well.

Biff talks about his various jobs and how he has tried to do such a wide variety of things but never succeeds as they do not always work out for him. This aspect of Biff's life gets him discouraged and feeling down. Then his brother, Happy, who is a somewhat successful salesman, at least more successful than Biff, also puts pressure on Biff to become successful. He does not want to be the brother in the family who does not amount to anything and lets his family down. This pressure from his brother, in addition to the stress of his career not going anywhere, causes Biff to feel out of place in his family. He dreads feeling as if he is a disappointment.

Biff continues to feel this way despite certain hiccups within his family, such as his father, Willy, growing old and suffering certain mental disorders. The fact that this feeling of not belonging takes over Biff while he is also dealing with other feelings towards his family shows just how significant it is for an individual to feel out of place. To feel out of place anywhere in life, especially in your own family, is something that can hold a strong influence on someone's perspective of life and overall approach to life itself.

We can see this in Death of a Salesman as Biff is going off to bars and increasingly shows signs of indifference towards his life and all of the things in it. Biff begins to dread the mundaneness of his life but loses the ambition to do anything to change that or chase anything new in his life. This detrimental loss of ambition can also be an effect of Biff simply feeling out of place in his family.

Towards the end of Death of a Salesman, Biff unleashes his anger on his father for an event that he experienced in his childhood. In Biff's climax of emotions, he reveals that he is tired of his family pretending all the time and acting as if everything is perfect even when it is not. This resentment towards fakeness that Biff shares could be a significant reason as to why he would feel out of place in his family. This difference between Biff and his family could be an aspect to embrace as they could use it to teach each other and learn of their differing perspectives on life and opposing coping mechanisms when dealing with situations that do not go as planned. However, the unfortunate turn of events ends with a more negative and morbid note rather than a positive solution. This unfavorable conclusion influences the interpretation of the novel by expressing the message of a negative connotation towards differences in the family.

The author's underlying tone of the story sets up the readers to subconsciously adopt a negative view on feeling out of place when really it could be seen as something to learn from and embrace. The experience of feeling out of place, which Biff undergoes, causes his entire perspective of his life as well as his family to be tainted with negativity. The way in which the author illustrates this to the reader can create an underlying interpretation that people who feel out of place can struggle to find happiness and positivity.

This message is important to readers because it can teach them the significance behind inclusivity and how much of a difference you as an individual can have in another individual's life, whether that be positive or negative."
3,"William Shakespeare's Hamlet is a culmination of many plotlines, though as a whole, it showcases the main character (Hamlet) feeling out of place in many circumstances, contributing to any and all interpretations of the work. Though it is true that the story is of the classic revenge archetype, that alone characterizes it as canonically 'out of place'. The main character, in his interpersonal and internal relationships, is what makes it a complex story to read and understand.

Beginning with the more complicated concept of internal dialogue and relationship with oneself, Prince Hamlet of Denmark shows in his many soliloquies and monologues that he finds turmoil in himself. While it could be argued that a cry for help to oneself about his failures as an actor, a ramble to which it is unclear if it is spoken to the audience or to himself as a justification and self-therapizing, is not a true definition of feeling out of place, it is also easy to argue that it is. Mere moments after what most readers would define as a positive interaction between the prince and the acting troupe, Hamlet goes on to 'vent' and attempt to release his own tension in the safety of his lonesome before the text goes violent in dialogue. The character, in most adaptations, begins to shout and even make a scene, even though no other character is present until after he has spoken fully. In the external world, this would not be considered stability, so why even for fiction should we deem it as such? The feeling of crawling in one's skin, even emotionally, can be seen in many actions, and as it is seen nearing the middle to end of the play, interrupting a play that has already been altered, once more to monologue and interrupt the world created for him, is not the most 'sane' option. Another simple example tied into this was the lack of morality and seemingly filter, as Hamlet continually disrespected his former lover (in social or romantic light, Ophelia), in public before the play had begun.

This then transitions into the following example, which is the interpersonal interactions Hamlet has. Simply put: Hamlet's father was murdered by a man who not only lives but has begun to control the prince in every aspect. From putting Ophelia up to the task of eavesdropping on conversations to ruling the kingdom that logically Hamlet should inherit, Claudius has placed the prince into a position outside the life he has control over. This plot, while demonstrating the distance between Hamlet and a life of his choosing, also shows readers a psychological understanding from between the lines that may not have been understood if it were as plain as it could have been.

Shakespeare, while having been a writer of much fame, also wrote in length his plays, consisting in this one of 5 acts. This extension to the average modern play (1-2 acts) gives viewers and readers time to process the corruption in both the hierarchy displayed and the characters shown. Many viewers would understand from first glance that from the complexity of each character's interactions with Prince Hamlet and his speeches to himself, he is outcasted. Social shunning and the death of his father created madness, which only grew as he learned that each of his loved ones had betrayed him, leaving him more and more alone. While it is an unfair fate, it is also a fate that even only socially, modern audiences can relate to. Trials and tribulations exist everywhere and can create a depth that, as seen in Hamlet, can affect both a character and any and all interpretations and replications of the original work."
3,"In Northanger Abbey, Catherine Morland feels out of place in a new society she is brought into. Her expectations of the people she would encounter in Bath were not met, as contrasting characters confuse Catherine and what she should believe about herself. The conflict she faces leaves her to rediscover who she is. In Northanger Abbey, contrasting characters and the conflict of the novel leave Catherine feeling out of place based on the expectations that reality did not live up to.

Catherine's experience in Bath led to an undeserving and confused state, as expectations of certain friendships were contrasted against one another. After arriving in Bath, Catherine is quickly introduced to two characters that try to transform her into becoming a proper lady. Isabella befriends Catherine with the wrong intentions. Because Catherine is new in a society full of people that act differently than her, Catherine immediately trusts Isabella. Eleanor is also made friends with Catherine. At first, Catherine tries to adapt to the lifestyles both women throw at her because she is in an unfamiliar place with high expectations of the people in it. Catherine wants to feel a part of this sophisticated society, so she participates in all the activities both women do and takes their advice on who to be. Eventually, Isabella's true intentions with Catherine are revealed through subtle things this character says. Because Catherine's hope of meeting new people in this fascinating place is let down with Isabella, she looks to Eleanor for all her support. Eleanor, living up to Catherine's original expectations, helps Catherine discover who she is and guides her to finding her place in Bath. Jane Austen is setting up this part of the book to alert readers that things aren't always what they seem.

Catherine's curiosity and need for adventure eventually lead to an altercation that led to Catherine questioning her place. During her time at Northanger Abbey, Catherine made the experience exciting by incorporating parts of the Gothic novels she would read into real life. This started out as harmless fun for Catherine but eventually got serious when she started messing with other people's lives and even resulting in accusing Mr. Tilney of murdering his wife. Her exciting expectations of Northanger Abbey were only lived inside her head. After her accusation was made light of, she was forced to leave Northanger Abbey in the middle of the night. Because she was returning home with nothing to show from her time away, she felt lost. This significant event in the novel ultimately led to her setback home. Jane Austen wrote this novel as a satire designed as an ordinary person taking a heroine's journey. It is made to be ironic that Catherine is returning home like a heroine would, but she is empty-handed."
3,"In the book ""1984"" written by George Orwell, Winston is a character who feels massively out of place from the very beginning of the book to the complete opposite at the end, fitting in so well that it's unsettling. The feeling of being out of place that Winston experiences is the driving point of the whole story, from when he first decides to write in the journal to the moment in the chestnut coffee shop when he hears that Oceania has won the war. A feeling of being out of place can drive people to do things they would have never done otherwise.

At the beginning of the book, we meet Winston, a seemingly average man who is later in his life. He lives in a world where everything is controlled by the ""Party"" and Big Brother, even your own thoughts are monitored and controlled by them. Winston is not very keen on this; he hates the Party and he hates Big Brother, so he starts a journal to write down his thoughts. Earlier in the day, the situation that motivated him to commit such an act of ""thought crime"" was a mere glimpse of mutual respect between someone he thought was trustworthy. This feeling of being out of place starts to affect his actions in his day-to-day life more and more, and he starts writing in his journal subconsciously, repeatedly writing ""DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER."" This contributes to the main thesis statement because if Winston had never felt out of place and fit right in with the status quo that the Party wants, none of the events in the story would occur.

Winston being out of place pushes him even further beyond just writing in a journal; he has sexual intercourse with a woman other than his wife, Julia, another person who, just like Winston, feels out of place. Together, they rent a room above Mr. Charrington's shop and meet there on several occasions to have sex and discuss the workings of the Party. If neither of them had ever felt this way, not a single event in this story would occur, and there would be no book. The whole agenda of the Party is to have control over the thoughts of the people. They destroy literature, newspaper articles, photos, and even dictionaries of words they don't want to be a part of the official vocabulary. The Party doesn't want anyone to feel out of place, and they squash that feeling as soon as it starts to fester, leaving the ""thought criminals"" even more defeated than they were.

George Orwell wrote what could be considered a cautionary story, a story of a time and place that society could very well end up in. Feeling out of place from a societal standpoint has never been good, and it never feels good. You feel lonely, and that feeling can lead to radical idealism. But it can also help with knowing when a change needs to happen if that feeling is justified, as it is in the book ""1984""."
3,"In Franz Kafka's ""Metamorphosis,"" the main character Gregor wakes up one day to find that he has mysteriously transformed into a bug overnight. Despite this shocking realization, he quickly gets out of bed in a frenzy, worrying about being late for work and the potential impact it could have on his career. Although he notices differences in his appearance and abilities, he fails to fully acknowledge the significance of his transformation. As the story progresses and Gregor interacts with others, he becomes increasingly isolated, with no one to turn to in times of need. This emphasizes the idea that feeling isolated and out of place in life will ultimately lead to one's downfall.

One example of Gregor's isolation is his relationship with his father, a man who values success more than family. From the beginning, his father berates Gregor about his failed career and how he no longer has any personal worth. He criticizes Gregor for his past choices and suggests that his transformation should leave him feeling ashamed. This leaves Gregor feeling worthless, as he has spent his entire life trying to please his father and make a name for himself. He also feels lost, as he no longer has a sense of purpose or direction in life. Any hope of repairing their relationship is shattered when his father throws a book at his back. This leaves Gregor feeling embarrassed, betrayed, and incredibly lonely, symbolizing his ultimate downfall.

Another example of Gregor's isolation is seen in his relationship with his sister. Initially, she continues to care for Gregor and look after him, regardless of whether he is human or a bug. This provides some comfort to Gregor, as he knows that someone still sees worth in him. However, this does not last, and he gradually goes from eating human food and having a clean room to surviving on leftover garbage scraps and living in filth. This changing relationship is soul-crushing for Gregor, as he feels himself losing touch with those he thought would always be there for him. It also signifies a shift in the way others perceive him, as it is not just his father who fails to see him for who he truly is. Overall, this deepens Gregor's sense of isolation, as nobody can see beyond his physical appearance to the person he has always been on the inside.

Lastly, Gregor's downfall can also be attributed to his deteriorating relationship with his mother. Initially, she focuses on him being her son rather than a worthless bug. She continues to show love and care for him until others around her convince her that it is no longer worth trying to find hope in the situation. The collapse of this relationship is the final blow to any sense of hope that Gregor still clings to.

In conclusion, ""Metamorphosis"" illustrates the devastating consequences of isolation and feeling out of place in one's own life. Gregor's transformation into a bug serves as a metaphor for his alienation from society and his loved ones. His relationships with his father, sister, and mother all contribute to his ultimate downfall, as they fail to see him for who he truly is. This tragic tale serves as a reminder of the importance of connection and understanding in our lives, and the devastating consequences that can arise when we feel isolated and misunderstood."
3,"In the novel, 1984, the author depicts the experiences of two specific characters who feel out of place in their community and even in their own bodies: Winston and Julia. The story is set in a dystopian society in which free thought, or any thought at all, is strictly prohibited by the government figure of Big Brother. Using telescreens, recording devices, and alleged spies, the fear instilled into every citizen prevents ""thought-crime"" from occurring. The reader quickly picks up on the fact that this law is nearly impossible to prevent, and inevitably, the main character and narrator, Winston, begins to think.

While in any other society his actions would be accepted, even the initial intent frightens Winston, and he is forming an internal battle within himself. This battle, of course, created by society, is hard to establish considering the lifelong threat and unknown that follows thought-crime. Due to this, the reader is taken along his battle throughout the story, which helps depict the importance and understanding of how a society can impact citizens due to its strong will and overpowering behavior.

These unknown thoughts that are new and frightening to Winston make him question everything, including his own belonging inside himself. He feels a disconnect between mind and body, as said throughout the novel. Winston decides that this uneasy feeling is not from himself, but from Big Brother. In his attempt to overthrow Big Brother in pursuit of freedom of thought, he meets a girl, Julia, who the reader soon realizes is also committing crimes against the government.

Julia, a freethinking teenage girl, meets Winston as secretly as possible, and they begin an intimate relationship. Instantly, it is noted that Julia is not as intellectual as Winston, but she shares the hatred for the government, which brings them closer together. Winston, being the literal overthinker of the couple, brings up the promise that drives the demise of them both. They make the promise to love each other, another illegal action both are aware of.

While both characters know of the society's rules and know that what they are doing, thinking, feeling, and saying goes against them, they feel as though they were meant to feel so strongly, even if they feel out of place.

To conclude, characters often feel out of place to help drive the interpretation of a story into a deeper, more meaningful connection to the reader."
3,"In the short story ""The Necklace,"" the main character feels out of place in her community due to her greed and overambitious ideas of believing she deserves to be rich, even though she is in a low-class area. In the short story, the main character is invited to a rich ball by her husband, yet she starts crying because she doesn't have anything fancy to wear. The character is emotionally affected because her desire to look rich won't be accomplished with a simple gown. In her distraught state, her husband offers her 400 francs to buy a dress, although that money was originally saved up to buy a hunting gun. The character suddenly becomes proud and happy now that she got what she wanted. She gets her dress, but one problem arises - she is not satisfied with what she has since she feels she needs a necklace to go with it.

Sooner or later, she goes to her rich friend's house to ask to borrow a necklace. After multiple attempts to find the perfect necklace, she finally finds the most sparkly one. During this scene, the character continues to ask for more, allowing her greed to take over, resulting in her obtaining a very expensive necklace. After that encounter, our main character goes to the ball and is enraptured in joyfulness, while her husband sits down waiting for her. By the end of the ball, she rushes out in hopes of not being seen by anyone. Once she gets home, she is shocked to discover that she has lost the necklace. Her husband offers to tell her friend, but her embarrassment prevents her from coming forward with the truth. The pair buys a new necklace, gives it to her friend, and are now left in debt that they have to pay for the next ten years.

She sees her friend at the park, and her friend barely recognizes her due to how overworked our main character has become. Our character then comes to find out that the original necklace was a fake, which only costed 500 francs. Because of her shame to come forward, they had to pay 10,000 francs. Since the character felt out of place, she turned into this greedy person who ultimately had to pay for the consequences of her actions. The interpretation of this work as a whole is that you don't always have to fit into the crowd, and that you should always be honest because you don't know where that can lead you."
3,"In the book, ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"", Janie feels perpetually out of place in her search for a good husband. Her own grandmother told her to forget her roots, for she had none. Janie experiences the feeling of being out of place, and this feeling affects her by driving her to find where she belongs and who she is.

Throughout the book, she was married to three men because she wanted to find someone who would complete her. The three men she married were her three trials. The first man she married treated her like a mule, not a wife. He wanted her to do everything he was doing along with what he thought she should be doing as his wife. Janie had enough of this when he threatened her, so she left him.

She found another man who was ambitious and full of pride, and he moved them to a town where he became the mayor, but he did not want her involved in anything he was doing. He simply wanted her around as an object to him. He treated Janie like a doll. Janie realized that he did not appreciate her or recognize her own ambition, so she left him, and soon after that, he died.

Janie moved on and later found a younger man that loved her for who she is, and his name was Tea Cake. Tea Cake appreciated her ambition, and they worked together in a marshy area with many other freed slaves, and Janie found a place where she could finally fit in, but in a storm, it was destroyed. Tea Cake was bitten by a rabid dog, and when he attacked her, Janie was forced to shoot him. She had lost everything, so she returned back to her hometown.

During her three trials, she had been in search of a perfect man, but on her return home, she found the perfect woman: herself. She had been longing to find the person who completed her, but after she had gone through three marriages, she had finally completed herself. The place she belonged was in her own home with herself; she did not need anyone else to make her feel accepted.

Janie felt out of place in all three of her marriages, but when she had given up on finding a man, she found herself. She found that she did not need anyone or anything to make her feel accepted, fell back into place when she accepted her own body and mind. Janie found acceptance in herself, and without the effects of her past marriages, she would have never found that."
3,"In the story ""Pygmalion,"" Eliza is motivated to undergo an extreme personality transformation because she feels out of place. The author uses character motivations to highlight the effects of being an outcast on Eliza's character.

Throughout the story, Eliza feels ridiculed and embarrassed because she is in the lowest class of society and can barely support herself. She refers to herself as a lady and believes that she does not belong in the lowest class, but she is also dismayed when she realizes she is not proper enough for the middle class either. Her feelings of discomfort with her situation drive her to attempt to change in order to fit in with the higher social classes.

In her heart, she knows she is a lady who is deserving of respect, and she attempts to earn it. She stands up for herself when people treat her poorly and reminds them that she deserves to be treated well. But no matter where she goes, she never feels like she belongs. She begins to change her outward appearance and develop 'proper' manners in order to appear more ladylike. She becomes increasingly frustrated with the facade of society, which only motivates her to try and fit in further.

The experience of feeling out of place only made her more confident in her own morals and personality because she discovered that 'fitting in' with the upper class was solely based upon appearances. This realization further forms the plot and highlights the theme of appearances in the story, which affects the interpretation of the story itself.

Eliza's feelings and frustration lead to her desire to change in order to stop feeling out of place. But in the end, it seems that being 'out of place' is just a concept created by society. Eliza does not truly change anything about herself aside from her speech pattern and her clothing, but she is immediately accepted by the upper class. Her feelings and motivations contribute to the idea that the novel is based on the value of outward appearances in society."
4,"In the play ""The Death of a Salesman,"" Willy Loman, the protagonist, feels at odds with almost every aspect of his life, and in order to combat this feeling of displacement, he chooses to re-envision the world in his narrow viewpoint. The tension of the play stems from the fact that the world's realities often play in direct opposition to Willy's distorted viewpoint. Willy modifies his family's narrative in a way that aligns with his notions of the world, such as adamantly claiming his sons are studly athletes and that he is a far better salesman than he actually is, in order to prevent himself from noticing that he is a lost soul in a world that has passed him by.

The play starts with Willy's small townhouse being engulfed in a sea of monstrous apartment complexes, indicating from the play's inception that Willy is out of place in this new world as he desperately clings onto the past.

Willy is soon revealed as a salesman who has constant daydreams of the past, where he envisions his sons, Biff and Happy, as ""adonises"" who are destined for success. These daydreams show that Willy feels out of place in this new reality and wishes to be transported to the past where the world was understandable for him. Willy boasts of his sons' athletic accomplishments and believes that they must be flaunted by women at their school. In reality, it is shown that Biff and Happy grow up to be merely mediocre athletes and sleazy lovers, with Happy constantly having affairs with his bosses' wives and Biff becoming too self-conscious to date. When presented with this fact by his own sons, Willy disregards their confession as simple modesty and brings up his fictionalized family's past as evidence of their greatness. Willy detaches himself from reality because if he didn't, he would have to accept the shocking revelation that he doesn't fit into the world any longer.

Willy's ability to distort the truth extends to his work as well. When his wife, Linda, asks how much he made on a recent business trip to New York, he lies and gives a drastically inflated number. When Linda congratulates him on his fantastic work, Willy concedes that he actually brought in a slightly lower figure than he initially claimed. Linda, still impressed, explains that the sum is still more than enough. Willy, after this second round of confirmation, confesses again that he exaggerated the second time as well. He continues this charade until finally revealing that he barely made enough to cover their living expenses. This is a prime example of how Willy is unable to accept the world's lack of care for his salesmanship and his ultimate lack of place.

Willy's lack of claiming responsibility for his detachment is shown to be a trait that plagued even his younger years, as his son Happy recounts surprising his father on one of his business trips only to find him having an affair with an associate. Willy felt like he wasn't getting the praise he needed from his family or work, so he supplemented it with this affair. When he is finally caught, he refuses to admit to his cheating or to his feelings. Willy cannot accept that he feels socially distant from the world, so he must turn to a world of lies once again.

Overall, Willy Loman is a man incredibly lost in a newfound social and economic world, and instead of admitting to this displacement and coping with it normally, it is easier for him to pretend that the world is different and one in which he still belongs."
4,"In Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" the monster's experience of being shunned from society and rejected by his creator has a profound impact on his mental and physical well-being. This contributes to the central themes of the human need for companionship and the nature vs. nurture debate. These themes are also prevalent in our society today, from the ostracization of individuals in schools to the emotional struggles faced by children raised in orphanages.

From the very beginning, the monster is thrown into a world that cannot accept him. He is devoid of support and affection, left to learn and grow on his own by observing others and reading books. He quickly realizes that his ghastly appearance is the reason for his rejection, a feature he had no control over. This sense of being out of place leads him to develop independence at an accelerated rate. However, this rapid development takes a toll on his mental well-being, as he has no one to share his thoughts with. He understands that there is no one who would listen to him, given his monstrous appearance. This highlights the importance of human companionship and the detrimental effects of isolation on one's mental state. This feeling of being out of place can be compared to the experiences of orphans in the foster care system, who often lack the opportunity to form deep connections. Consequently, they have a higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activities once they are released into the world without proper support systems in place.

The monster's upbringing in a harsh and unforgiving world hardens his temperament at an early stage of his development. At one point, he attempts to save a child from drowning in a river, but instead of receiving gratitude, he is attacked for his actions. This highlights the physical consequences of his alienation from society, as he is injured while trying to do a good deed. It also underscores the nature vs. nurture debate, as the creature is not inherently malicious. Instead, his thirst for revenge and destruction is a result of his circumstances. Furthermore, when his creator denies his one wish for companionship, the monster violently rebels and kills those whom Victor cherishes. This hostile reaction stems from his alienation from society and his own creator, as he is deprived of the one thing he longs for. Once again, this demonstrates that he is not inherently evil, but rather driven to extreme measures due to his exclusion and the absence of any sense of belonging. The monster can be compared to an innocent child who resorts to rebellion and violence after experiencing alienation, lacking the guidance and counseling necessary to manage their emotions in a healthier manner.

In conclusion, the negative experiences of being shunned from society and rejected by his creator have a profound impact on the monster in ""Frankenstein."" His mental and physical well-being suffer as a result, highlighting the themes of the human need for companionship and the nature vs. nurture debate. These themes are also prevalent in our society today, as individuals continue to face ostracization and emotional struggles. It is crucial that we recognize the importance of inclusion and support, as well as the potential consequences of neglecting these fundamental human needs."
4,"In the novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, Zora Neale Hurston conveys Janie's feelings of being out of place within society for not wanting to conform to the gender roles of being a modest, obedient wife. Hurston uses Janie's point of view exclusively to express her feelings of being out of place for wanting love throughout her life, and it being the one thing she wanted wholeheartedly.

Since coming into her womanhood, she has always had the dream of finding true love and naively thought that if she were to be married, she would have the love she longed for. Janie and Nanny had always disagreed on what marriage was meant to be. Janie wanted love, but Nanny saw marriage as a way to ensure her protection. Nanny had always prayed to God to let her live until Janie could be married to ensure she would be safe and taken care of. This foreshadowed her death shortly after Janie had gotten married to her first husband, Logan Killicks, because her purpose had been fulfilled. However, her marriage was not what she wanted and did not contain the love she sought after.

Janie knew that this man was not who she was meant to be with and that the life of a wife living within a loveless marriage was not meant for her. So, she then looked for a way out of the cage she felt trapped in. Janie found means of escape through Joe Starks, a man who gave her the promise of change and love, only to later realize he is using her as a trophy wife and she has only found herself in another cage. Joe Starks is a controlling man who forces Janie to cover her long hair, symbolizing him taking control of her womanhood and freedom. The symbolism of her femininity through her hair is expressed throughout the novel as a way to represent her freedom and sexuality.

Janie's marriage with Joe is a test of her perseverance to get out and once again be free from the shackles of another loveless marriage with a man whose only goal is to present her as a prize for others to gaze upon. Despite the wealth and promise of being able to live a comfortable life while married to Joe, she knows that she will never be truly happy without real love that she has always sought since her youth. Janie expresses her loss of control of not only her body but her mind. Joe controls every aspect of her, but she knows deep down that being treated as an object only to be used to better his image is not the existence she was meant for.

The novel then shifts with the introduction and death of her final husband, Tea Cake, who finally had given her the comfort and love she had searched for all her life and also taught her that she didn't need to please anyone as long as she had love for herself. After his death, Janie knew that there was nothing left for her there with Tea Cake gone, so she finally returned back home to reminisce on her past. Hurston uses each of her marriages as an obstacle to overcome in order to truly achieve her goal of love. Each man teaches her a lesson of self-discovery to become the selfless and self-loving woman she is by the end.

Although Janie is truly out of place in the end, being a woman without a husband or giving in to the eager ears of her neighbors, she just feels content and happy. She no longer feels out of place because she knows she has finally gotten the love she wanted in the end, and that's all she ever needed."
4,"""Wide Sargasso Sea"" is the prequel to the novel ""Jane Eyre"". In the novel, the main character Antoinette is faced with the feeling of being out of place. She experiences this feeling not only within her community but also within her family, culture, and her own body.

As a young girl, after her mother gets remarried, Antoinette struggles with her mother's new husband and forms a deep disdain towards him. This causes a rift between her and her mother's relationship and develops a sense of non-belonging within her own family, which she struggles with from a young age. Due to this tense family relationship, she often feels alone as a child and longs for the sense of approval that only her family can provide. Without this approval and love, which is needed as Antoinette develops, she struggles as she grows up, feeling out of place and ultimately alone in her life.

This then begins Antoinette's spiral towards insanity through her lack of belonging in her own family. If her family could have accepted and loved her without pushing her aside, her eventual demise could have been avoided as she may have at least found comfort and a sense of belonging within her own family. However, as she did not find this comfort and belonging within her family, her struggles continued even outside her family.

When Antoinette grew up, she noticed that due to her race, she was also alone in the world. Due to her skin color and being from an island, she had to deal with taunting from both European white people, who found her too black, and black people, who found her too white. Thus, due to the color of her skin and the island she was from, she could not conform enough to either race to be accepted by them. This left her outcasted and ridiculed from a young age until her death, for something she is completely unable to control. 

Due to this struggle, she is constantly left uncomfortable in her community and culture, wondering whether she will ever be accepted by anyone or if she will always feel this alone and outcasted in society. Due to all this torment and lack of belonging, she never quite feels at peace with who she is, which later leads to her lack of belonging even in her own body.

Without the support of anyone around her, even her family, Antoinette struggles with a lack of identity and a feeling of non-belonging wherever she goes. Due to the immense amount of loneliness from the lack of belonging, lack of family bonds, and confused racial identity, Antoinette suffers from feeling out of place in her own body as she approaches madness. She no longer can sense time, place, reality, or who she is. Through her confused identity and lack of belonging, Antoinette is driven to insanity and feels out of place even within herself. She identifies with no one and can no longer even identify herself.

This is essential to the development of the novel. Antoinette's loss and lack of identity in the novel help to develop the novel's central ideas about loneliness and the effects it may have on a person."
4,"In the story Frankenstein, we see what could potentially happen if one is left as an outsider. However, in Frankenstein's case, he is more than just an outsider; he is seen as a monster that was created and casted as an outcast to society because the one person that truly mattered left him. From the moment Frankenstein's monster is born and brought to life, we see that the person who made him looked at him with disgust and fear. So much so that he left him for over a week in the room because of the monster's appearance.

Later on, we see Frankenstein's monster being seen by other people, and they view him as a monster that should be killed due to his hideous appearance. This story proves that appearances matter. People who are blessed with good looks, handsomeness, and beauty are more likely to have little things done for them, such as someone holding a door for them, getting their order right, or treating them nicer. They can also get away with more, like actual crimes. Additionally, attractive people are more likely to make friends and not feel as though they don't belong in a place where they actually do belong.

When it comes to the monster, he is not handsome; he is disfigured and unattractive. Due to these features, he is cast out due to something he can't control. The consequences that lead to him being mistreated are murder. He kills people because he gets upset, and since he was born only a few weeks or months ago, he doesn't really understand that it is very bad to kill someone out of anger. But this is a consequence from society for treating him like garbage.

The funny thing is, the monster is really intelligent. He learns to read and write in different languages and acquires some social skills. However, these accomplishments, actual accomplishments, are overshadowed due to his appearance and people's lack of sympathy, understanding, and compassion for one another. Just having a bushy unibrow can cause people to speak less to you or avoid speaking to you entirely. Outcasting someone is one of the most dangerous and evil things you can do. It can cause mental health to decline and result in long-lasting physical and psychological damage to the person. And that's just the beginning.

When it comes to the monster, he is outcasted from the beginning of his life. Since he was born, he was an outcast, a monster not fit for life, even though he was created out of a laboratory from human remains that were seen as beautiful. This is what the story is telling us: abandoning someone will permanently damage them, especially if you do it at a young age. Kids raised by just a father or just a mother don't develop correctly or entirely. Frankenstein's monster probably would've turned out to be a scientist or a philosopher if Frankenstein didn't abandon him and leave him with the cruel, cold world that treated him like an outcast and caused him to commit murders."
4,"In Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis,"" Gregor's sense of unbelonging is morbidly seen when he abruptly transforms into a vermin, with his family's immediate disdain for existence conveying that approval is conditional. Before Gregor's untimely metamorphosis, his family held some reverence for him as he was the breadwinner, allowing them to sustain themselves. After the circumstances morphed to where he could no longer work to sustain the family, his family's change was immediate.

Overnight, Gregor lost humanity, not in the sense of the mind but in the body. He no longer appeared human; he became a disgusting vermin, terrifying his family and vilifying him in the eyes of his father. Gregor only had one purpose: to make money. And with that ability stripped from him, he no longer held any use for his family members, forcing his father to reenter the workforce. His family no longer cared for him, spent time with him, or could even look upon him without disgust.

This hurt the human side of Gregor, who now spent his days locked in a room, crawling around, giving more and more into his animalistic side coincidentally with his family's growing disdain. It became more and more evident that there was no unconditional love for Gregor. His mother was unable to gaze upon him, and his father eventually assaulted him with an apple after Gregor frightened his mother, leaving an apple lodged into his carapace as a reminder that his family dehumanized him and that they no longer accepted him, but merely tolerated his existence.

Gregor feels out of place, no longer belonging to the family he loves as they no longer reciprocate. He one-sidedly looks on as his family distances themselves more and more, feeling more and more lonely as time goes on, loosening the tether on his humanity with no interaction to chain him there as he gives in more and more to the bug. His family's disdain grows daily for harboring a disgusting bug, pushing Gregor further into unacceptance and loneliness.

Through the catalyst of feeling lonely and out of place, it is shown that acceptance is conditional, through the immediate change in Gregor's interpersonal relationships after his transformation. The loneliness pushes him away from humanity, towards the bug. No longer useful, Gregor is persecuted and eventually killed by his own father without remorse, showing that his father no longer considers him his son and that his acceptance was conditional upon his usefulness. This is demonstrated through the catalyst of Gregor's loneliness."
4,"In the novel Of Mice and Men, which takes place on a ranch in California during the 1920s and the Great Depression, women's rights were limited and women were mistreated and given limited opportunities. Curley's wife, the only woman on the ranch, exhibits a sense of being out of place within the community. Being the only woman during this time was extremely difficult, and throughout the novel, she is constantly dehumanized because of her gender. She is never given a name other than ""Curley's wife,"" emphasizing her role as her husband's possession.

In one scene, when she is conversing with Lennie, who is trying to avoid her because she is known to seek attention from other men, she exclaims, ""I'm only allowed to talk to Curley!"" Her anger at how she is being treated is ignored and dismissed, making her feel even more out of place. She feels the need to seek attention from other men, but is seen as disloyal and an attention seeker simply because she is a woman. However, it is important to note that her circumstances and the time period she is living in make it seem like the only way for her to survive.

Curley's wife feels isolated throughout the novel because everyone on the ranch is prohibited from speaking with her due to her husband's jealousy. She is only able to find some sense of community with Lennie, whom she begins to flirt with. However, Lennie is warned to stay away from her because she is seen as a troublemaker. In reality, Curley's wife's loneliness stems from feeling out of place, which leads her to feel desperate and seek attention through flirting.

Throughout the novel, Curley's wife is portrayed as a troublemaker and attention seeker, but in reality, she simply feels out of place. The only time she opens up and reveals her failed dreams and aspirations is when she confides in Lennie. This shows that because she constantly feels out of place, she is unable to be her true self and is perceived as less than she actually is.

In conclusion, Curley's wife's character is seen as attention-seeking because of her desperation and loneliness caused by feeling out of place. She is only able to find a sense of community with Lennie, who also feels isolated due to his mental disorder. Both characters share a similar loneliness from the rest of the ranch, and it is through their interactions that the true depth of Curley's wife's character is revealed."
4,"In many books, films, short stories, and poems, isolation plays a big factor in many of the protagonist and antagonist characters' motivations and behaviors. In the book The Handmaid's Tale, the female characters' feelings of being out of place, isolation, and lack of belonging all contribute to the idea that isolating individuals for specific reasons leads to the dehumanization and degradation of an entire group.

In The Handmaid's Tale, women who are able to give birth are taken away, stripped of all rights, and turned into objects. One scene that highlights this process of dehumanization is when the main character, June, witnesses the other handmaids being forced to point and scream ""dirty!"" and ""whore!"" at a young girl who had been raped by their peer. This scene reveals not only the stripping of the girl's voice and story but also the impact it has on June. In order to belong with the rest of the group, she has to cast out and degrade another.

Another scene that reinforces the theme of belonging is when June, after giving birth to a child and going through the struggle of labor, is cast out and not allowed to hold her own child. Seen and treated as objects for the rich wives and husbands who rape them, the main character's friend ends up committing suicide. Instead of changing their behavior, the handmaids and other women are reminded of their place in society.

While this is just one of the many scenes that prompt June to try and escape, these moments of dehumanization and isolation are very prevalent in today's political climate. The recent leak of a supreme court document declaring that Roe v. Wade is to be overturned, essentially taking away the rights of millions of women, further exposes how many of these laws will push people into situations where they will be isolated and feel out of place in society. This will inevitably lead to the degradation and dehumanization of these individuals.

Because of this, the quote ""The Handmaid's Tale is about the future"" is the best and most prevalent interpretation of this book. It serves as a warning of the potential consequences of isolating and dehumanizing individuals based on specific reasons, and highlights the importance of belonging and inclusion in society."
4,"In Tim O'Brien's novel, ""The Things They Carried,"" the narrator Tim uses his own personal accounts of war, in addition to the stories of other soldiers, to describe their feelings of being 'out of place' within themselves, their community, and within their families.

Throughout the novel, O'Brien gives accounts of stories during the Vietnam War. Many of these stories discuss O'Brien's personal encounters and difficulties he faced, while others discuss the stories of other soldiers. In these accounts, it is known that the aftermath of war destroyed the personal bodies of many soldiers, causing them to feel out of place within their own bodies.

After the war, many soldiers suffered from PTSD, a disoriented mental state, flashbacks, mental disorders, and physical body issues as well. The issues that each soldier and person faced after, and even during, the war made soldiers feel worthless. They felt uncomfortable in their own bodies and were afraid to show themselves after the war.

In the specific instances of Tim, he suffered from several mental and emotional traumas, anxiety, and PTSD. He was then forced to deal with the aftermath of these emotions for the rest of his life. For O'Brien, there was a lack of treatments for his conditions, making his situation even worse. This widely known feeling of O'Brien demonstrates the conditions that himself and many other soldiers faced, since so many soldiers knew that they were not mentally and physically stable in their own bodies.

There should be a wider push for our society to be more accepting and understanding of those who have been through trauma such as war. If this were to happen, people such as O'Brien and his fellow soldiers would be able to feel more confident in knowing that there are countless other people dealing with mental disorders and trauma as well, and that they are not the only ones feeling 'out of place' with themselves."
4,"In ""The Scarlet Letter,"" the protagonist is isolated from her community due to her committing an act of adultery; however, this isolation from the town strengthens her character and the overall theme of the book.

First, the town decides to place the letter A on her clothing to attempt to ruin her relationship with others and isolate her from social interaction. The protagonist, however, does not shake. She shows pride in her isolation. She embroiders the letter to let everyone know that she has no shame. Her adultery, to her, is not an act of shame but of pride. The town's disapproval of her actions only strengthens her acceptance of herself.

The protagonist, as a whole, grows through her isolation and received judgment. She becomes more independent. She embraces her true self, and she will not let anyone hold her down, not even a letter. Her newfound self ironically builds relationships with the town. At first, they despised her, but after her acceptance of herself, they look up to her. They could not have done what she did. Her feelings of isolation, how she grows due to those feelings, and the town's interactions with her dramatically hint at the overall theme: contentment and acceptance of one's actions and self.

The antagonist, her husband, and her love interest die because of their separate mischievous and hidden sins, yet she thrives. She gets to live her life with her daughter, unashamed. Without her isolation, the wearer of the scarlet letter would not have changed. She needed the town to judge, despise, and exile her in order to become the strong, independent woman she is at the end of the book. Her adversity and feelings of separation are crucial to her character development and the overall development of the theme."
4,"In Frankenstein, the reader gets a glimpse of the ways the creature Frankenstein created struggles to fit in with others. Throughout the book, we witness the experiences the creature has to endure simply because of his physical, mental, and emotional differences from mankind.

To begin with, his own creator was terrified of what he had created, and his first experience from being brought to life was fear from the first person he had encountered. Unlike the majority of individuals who gradually experience the feeling of being out of place, they at least had loving interaction from family and parents as children. Frankenstein's creature had never received that welcome from others, and the person who would most likely welcome him was terrified of his own creation.

This leads to a negative effect on the creature because he is now going out into the world with no prior knowledge or understanding of the way society works. He is also different from other humans, so he has not learned enough about himself and doesn't have someone to guide him through life. His confusion and lack of knowledge cause him to go looking for Frankenstein, and in the process of doing so, he begins to grow hatred for his creator.

The reader begins to notice the character development in Frankenstein's creature. He went from being frightened and confused to someone who begins to feel emotions, especially showing his disdain for Frankenstein. Then, there is another encounter with a family that he spent time observing from a distance, and this is the first time the audience witnesses the creature's desire for human interaction. He has felt lonely and unwanted for a long time, and observing the interaction between the family, we see his emotions begin to unravel."
4,"In The Poisonwood Bible (1998), Barbara Kingsolver tells the story of a white American missionary family that is forced to move to the imperialist Belgian Congo. Through their experiences, she emphasizes the cultural divide between the family, known as the Prices, and the seemingly less civilized way of life in the Congo. All of this takes place amidst a rising sociopolitical upheaval. Many of the characters in the family struggle to adapt to their new environment and find themselves feeling out of place. This is particularly evident in the character of Leah Price, who is open-minded and curious about the Congolese people. However, she becomes insecure because she is unable to fully assimilate with them due to her race and the connotations associated with her whiteness. Rachel Price, on the other hand, holds racist beliefs and has a narrow-minded perspective. She views the Congolese as inferior and is disgusted by their culture and society simply because they are African. These characterizations contribute to the thematic exploration of race and culture in Poisonwood. Kingsolver portrays demographics as a superficial barrier to mutual human understanding."
4,"In Brave New World, one of the protagonists, John, struggles with the dichotomy of two conflicting worlds and ideologies; inevitably coming to the devastating realization that he has no place in the ""new world"" of the novel. John exists in a world separated into two polarized societies: that of the ""civilized"" and ""savage"" worlds.

In the civilized world, people are raised in labs where they are genetically modified and conditioned to fulfill certain roles in society. Instant gratification, individual satisfaction, consumerism, and conformity are the principles by which modern society conducts itself. As such, families, intimacy, art, religion, and expression are abolished.

In contrast, ""savage"" societies persist on native reservations. Their way of life emphasizes passion, belief, brutality, and mortality. They have expression and art, but also great suffering and conflict. These are the two worlds John finds himself trapped between. For he is the son of a civilized woman, who found herself trapped in the ""savage"" reservation on a vacation gone wrong. When his mother, Linda, is brought back to civilized society, he finds himself more out-of-place and conflicted than ever before."
4,"Life of Pi is a fictional novel written by Yann Martel about a boy named Pi who is devoted to faith even during his struggle to survive. Pi practices a multitude of faiths, and he feels out of place in his family due to their strict Hinduism culture. His family disagrees with his reasoning and teases him for it, but it ends up helping him survive when the ship they are all traveling on sinks, and he is stuck on a lifeboat with savage animals. He uses his faith to keep him steady from the tiger Richard Parker and the hardships of the fight for survival.

Pi tells the story of his travels when he finally makes it to shore, but his story is not believed, and he is asked to tell a more realistic one. He does, and it highlights the savagery of humankind with cannibalism and killings. His interviewers feel out of place and confused when trying to choose a story to believe, which relates to the debate of interpretation of the story as a whole.

Pi feels out of place in his family as his parents do not agree with the multitude of faiths. However, Pi finds comfort in the irrational, which reflects how the reader interprets his survival story at the end."
4,"One's own inclusion in society and culture affects the entirety of their well-being and ability to live a prosperous life. ""Brave New World"" details the story of a futuristic utopian society called the World State. John the Savage is brought up in a native tribe that is rich with culture and morals. However, John feels out of place here due to his mother's origins. His strive for inclusion and to feel welcome leads him to venture out and attempt to conform to both his native culture and the culture of any place that he believes will accept him.

The feeling of being out of place that John experiences causes him harm, and his attempt to embrace conformity only worsens his situation. This leads to the conclusion that people conform to something they are not because they are desperate for the comfort of feeling like they belong somewhere. In conjunction with this, if one does not come to terms with the fact that they will always feel out of place, their never-ending strive to fit in ultimately ends in their own demise.

Inclusion in society and culture is crucial for one's well-being. When individuals feel accepted and valued, they are more likely to experience a sense of belonging and happiness. In ""Brave New World,"" the World State's emphasis on conformity and uniformity suppresses individuality and uniqueness. John, as an outsider, struggles to find his place in this society. He longs for a sense of belonging and tries to conform to the World State's culture, but his efforts only lead to his own suffering.

John's experience highlights the importance of embracing one's own identity and culture. In his attempt to conform, he loses touch with his native tribe's rich heritage and values. This loss of cultural identity further alienates him and exacerbates his feelings of being out of place. John's journey serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the dangers of forsaking our own culture and values in pursuit of acceptance.

Furthermore, the desire to fit in can be so strong that individuals are willing to conform to any culture or society that they believe will accept them. This desperation stems from the fear of being alone and isolated. However, blindly conforming to something that goes against one's true nature and beliefs only leads to a loss of self and personal fulfillment.

In conclusion, one's inclusion in society and culture significantly impacts their overall well-being and ability to live a prosperous life. John's experience in ""Brave New World"" demonstrates the negative consequences of trying to conform to a culture that does not align with one's true self. It is essential for individuals to embrace their own identity and culture, rather than sacrificing it in the pursuit of acceptance. Only by accepting and celebrating our uniqueness can we truly find a sense of belonging and live a fulfilling life."
4,"The feeling of being an outcast in a community can be one of the largest struggles a person can face in society. This feeling of not fitting in does not exclude characters in literature, even if they are not people. Mary Shelley's novel, ""Frankenstein,"" exemplifies a prime character who is seen as a mutant to society and has trouble fitting in.

The famous story of a mad scientist who attempts to recreate life from the dead succeeds in his lab and mistakenly creates a mutant who cannot function as a normal human, along with his physical distortion. Because of this, the monster he creates escapes and is forced to learn the ways of society on his own while simultaneously in hiding.

The feeling of being out of place that Frankenstein's monster experiences affects the character emotionally and intellectually. These feelings contribute to the work as a whole by creating conflict amongst the monster and every character he encounters, and heightens the fear factor with aspects like threats, ultimatums, and things of that nature."
4,"In the novel, ""The Things They Carried,"" by Tim O'Brien, the main character and narrator, Tim O'Brien, feels out of place in his conservative town when he considers fleeing for Canada upon his draft notice. This experience of feeling out of place affects O'Brien by causing him to betray his conscience and, in turn, develops the theme of fearing judgment.

O'Brien is characterized as a liberal young man who does not support the motives of the Vietnam War. However, he is drafted and must face his fears of both the war and exile. His friends and peers in his conservative town are fulfilling their civic duties and honorably going to serve in the war. The feeling of being out of place is introduced when O'Brien begins to ponder the idea of fleeing to Canada in the chapter ""On the Rainy River.""

His unpopular political opinions make him stand out in his family and town. Yet, he is terrified of the gossip and judgment that would be passed around his town if he were to follow his heart and not serve in the war. This fear of judgment leads O'Brien to betray his conscience and ultimately decide to go to war.

Throughout the novel, O'Brien explores the theme of fearing judgment. He constantly questions his decision to go to war and wonders if he made the right choice. He carries the weight of this fear and guilt with him, as symbolized by the physical and emotional burdens the soldiers carry in their backpacks.

O'Brien's experience of feeling out of place in his conservative town highlights the internal struggle he faces. He wants to follow his own beliefs and values, but the fear of judgment from his community holds him back. This conflict between personal conviction and societal expectations is a central theme in the novel.

In conclusion, Tim O'Brien's experience of feeling out of place in his conservative town shapes his character and influences his decision to go to war. The fear of judgment from his community leads him to betray his conscience and carry the burden of guilt throughout the novel. This exploration of fearing judgment is a significant theme in ""The Things They Carried."""
4,"Within the story of ""The Metamorphosis,"" the main character, who has been established to have led a healthy young life, finds himself having turned into an insect. He has the proportions of a human but is an insect nonetheless. Due to his change, which very much separates him from the other characters and his change in role in society, this transformation is able to contribute to a better understanding of the work as a whole.

The author is able to allow the reader to better interpret the point that once you lose your usefulness to those around you, in this case, due to feeling out of place, people may want to completely disregard all that you may have done and disregard all that you are. This is a cruel fate to behold and something that no one should have to suffer. By showing how cruel society can be to someone who becomes ""out of place"" and how we shouldn't repeat that, as it can be harmful to all those involved, the author hoped for the reader to interpret this message by using this story."
4,"In ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" by J.K. Rowling, a young orphan boy learns that he is part of a magical world of wizards, witches, and creatures that baffle his mind beyond his wildest dreams. Before he is accepted into the wizarding school, Harry is completely unaware that he has the ability to do magic. When he was a baby, both of his parents died, leaving him with his abusive aunt and uncle who hated magic, so they taught Harry nothing about it.

Harry feels immensely out of place living with his relatives. His cousin has made him his personal punching bag, and Harry has always had a feeling that he is different from everyone else. It is this feeling of being an outcast that allows Harry to show kindness in the wizarding world to others who seem like outcasts and helps him make true, genuine friends for the first time in his life. It is because of this kindness and genuine understanding of others that he has grown that he is able to ward off the book's villain in the final chapters."
4,"In F. Scott Fitzgerald's book, ""The Great Gatsby,"" Tom and his mistress, Myrtle, both cheat on their spouses for each other. They have their own hotel room where the affairs take place. One day, Tom, Myrtle, and some other people throw a party at their hotel room. Everything is going well until Myrtle repeatedly mentions Tom's wife, Daisy. Tom Buchanan slaps Myrtle out of anger. Later on, Myrtle's husband, Mr. Wilson, finds out about her affairs, so he locks her in an upstairs room in their house. Myrtle eventually escapes and runs into the street for help when she sees the car that she believes Tom is driving. However, Tom's wife, Daisy, is driving the car and she doesn't slow down for Myrtle. Daisy drives right into Myrtle and kills her. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's book, ""The Great Gatsby,"" Myrtle Wilson feels out of place within her family. These feelings cause her to cheat on her husband, and they ultimately lead to the death of Jay Gatsby."
5,"In a patriarchal society, it is difficult for a woman to feel in place with her community, her strengths, society, and her own body. This issue can be observed through many female characters in literary works and history, more specifically in the characterization of Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams' play, ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" In the play, Blanche's anger, confusion, and desperateness in her situation control both her own fate and the others around her.

Blanche Dubois is the sister of Stella, whom she lives with throughout the plot along with Stella's abusive husband. Blanche was formerly a woman who lived a comfortable lifestyle and did not have to rely on herself to afford her comfortability. Throughout the plot, Blanche is seemingly antagonized as she deceives men, controls her sister, has inappropriate relationships with minors, and progressively becomes more and more mad. A lot of Blanche's behavior is objectively inexcusable, but it is extremely important to observe the significance of her circumstances and situations to understand her choices and character as a whole.

During the early twentieth century in which the story was written, women often had no mobility in their society and had to rely on men or being born into wealth in order to live a comfortable lifestyle. Blanche no longer had either of these options to survive, which forced her into moving in with her sister to sustain herself, which eventually turns into the downfall of her life. Throughout her time in her sister's penthouse, she is overly dramatic, materialistic, and deceptive as she attempts to find a way to sustain her preferred ways of life. She deceives men and uses her fading beauty in hopes that a man can save her once again. To Blanche, her way of living and the only way that she can find a place in society is to be under the care of a man. Due to the way that society is structured, Blanche continues to set up lies toward other people and herself to cover up the feelings of emptiness and unfulfillment that society forces her to endure.

Blanche uses dark lighting, makeup, and persistent flirting as tools that she has mastered the use of to control men in her life so that she is able to live in a home and have money that she cannot make on her own. Eventually, this becomes Blanche's character, her only way of knowledge and sense of aspirations as it was pushed onto her as a way to survive in her society. Blanche herself states that she has always depended on the kindness of strangers. The complexity in this highlights that it is not necessarily in Blanche's moral favorability to be a freeloader, but because of her position as a woman in a patriarchal society, she has no choice but to rely on others to keep her in a state of society that she is forced into to begin with.

One way that can be identified that Blanche is more complex than her deceptive actions is when she defends Stella against her abusive husband and attempts to persuade her to leave her marriage. From this, we can understand that Blanche is extremely aware of the role that men and women play in society. Blanche can identify abuse and harm from men, yet she also understands how it is a woman's role to learn to take that abuse in order to live. Yet Blanche still looks for alternatives for her and her sister to live safely, even if it's under the arm of another man.

Throughout the plot, Blanche essentially adheres to the role of a ""woman,"" not necessarily a role that is true to herself, but a role she must oblige to in order to fit in, in order to live. She uses material such as cheap, decorative paper lanterns and makeup to hide and conceal a woman who is desperate, who is going mad from a society that has driven her to the shell of her own self, who seeks security in the very thing that continues to ruin her time and time again.

As Blanche does what she can with the knowledge and resources she has in order to overcome her situation, she spirals and gets progressively worse as a human being and is sentenced to her psych ward, while her sister stays in her penthouse with her abusive husband. In ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" it is not purely the displacement that Blanche feels throughout the sense of the plot, it is the way that society forces Blanche to feel displaced, consistently reprimands her for coming up with forced solutions, feeling emotions, and finding solace in immoral ways. Eventually, she becomes the antagonist that society has made her out to be."
5,"In Brave New World, the character John is out of place within the society of the book due to being raised in the completely different environment of the Savage Reservation. His feeling out of place from the rest of the members of society causes him to reject soma and deal with pain, react dramatically to his mother's death, and eventually his own suicide. The effects of him feeling out of place illustrate the author's theme that being different within one's own society can cause one to become destructive towards others and towards themselves.

Being raised within the Savage Reservation, John never learned to rely on soma like the rest of the people within the society of Brave New World. Like readers, he viewed soma as escapism and not solving any problems people had in their lives. As a result, he refuses to use soma like the rest of the characters and succumbs to feeling more emotional pain than anyone else. Although the rejection of soma is appropriate for one who never relied on it, it causes him to deliberately feel more pain. His approach to pain over relying on soma like everyone else symbolizes how being raised with different customs and traditions, although not inherently wrong, can cause one to deal with more pain and suffering than others simply because they are different. John's relationship with soma causes him to be destructive towards others, shaming his mother for indulging in it, as well as himself for never wanting to rely on it and feeling more pain.

John refused to live within the society of Brave New World. He felt the need to live alone away from society despite the pain that it caused him because he simply would rather suffer than live in the society he did not belong in. He lives his final days on a remote island praying to God and whipping himself for his sinful thoughts. After his privacy is intruded by the people again, after indulging in sexual activities with them, he feels he had betrayed his own beliefs and takes his life. John refusing to live within society and trapping himself alone with his thoughts and whipping himself reflects how he preferred pain and suffering in solitude than living within a society that he could not pretend to accept. Losing human interaction, John feels more and more pain but is content living like so. After he had been tempted by his sexual desires and sexually indulged with the people that had come to his island to watch him, he takes his own life as a means of justice for his actions. John's death reflects how he would have rather died than to live like the others that he had long rejected, showing how being out of place within one's own society can cause one to be destructive towards themselves.

John being raised outside the society of Brave New World and not accepting the same idea of death puts him out of place from everyone. When John witnesses his mother's death, rejecting his society's belief that death was peaceful and meaningless, he refuses to let his mother die painlessly and tries to wake her up from her soma trip, scaring the children that are nearby. Because of John's different beliefs from his society, he tries to cause his mother to feel pain during her death and crying miserably in front of all the children who are supposed to be conditioned to be desensitized towards death. Not only does John feel immense pain at his mother's death, he inflicts pain and damage on the people around him at the moment in an attempt to have someone that sympathized with him. His lack of others' sympathy causing him to inflict pain on others reflects how being alone and different can cause one to be destructive towards others."
5,"In the story Frankenstein, the creature depicted is literally shunned from society, causing it to feel abandoned and develop negative feelings towards society. The creature's experience of feeling out of place helps build the universal truth that society is cruel, especially towards those who are different.

Firstly, the upbringing of the creature is unique and unlike any member of society portrayed in the story. For example, the creature was born through unnatural means and electricity, as opposed to being conceived through the womb like everybody else. Despite Viktor being the creature's maker, it was Viktor's responsibility to father the creature accordingly. Society's cruelty towards the creature is first seen through Viktor's neglecting of it. This abandonment led to the creature feeling out of place and ultimately steered it towards a path of revenge. This revenge is later seen through the murder of Viktor's spouse. Viktor's neglect reinforces the idea of how cruel humans can be towards those that are different.

Secondly, another instance in which the creature feeling out of place affects the character is seen through the following example. The creature saved a young girl from death and was repaid with a bullet wound. Despite the creature going out of its way to do a kind deed that in no way benefited it, the creature was repaid with cruelty. The girl's father trying to rid of the creature because of its differences further establishes the creature feeling out of place. The creature's interactions with the young girl and the father harmed it physically and only caused it to feel even more out of place. The cruelties and fear portrayed by the young girl and father further solidify the idea that humans can be cruel towards individuals that are different.

Lastly, another moment where the creature is forced out of society can be seen through its interactions with the villagers. The creature went out of its way to do kind deeds for the villagers, such as providing food when it did not need to. Once the villagers were aware it was the creature giving them supplies, they chased it out of their village, all because the creature looked different. After these events unfolded, the creature felt even more alone than it previously did and had no sense of belonging, despite the good it tried to provide for others. The creature feeling out of place caused it to develop an even stronger resentment towards society. Through the villagers' cruel interactions with the creature, this helps show how humans can be cruel towards anything they deem different.

All in all, the creature is consistently wronged by society. The unjustified cruelty and shunning the creature undergoes push it onto a path of resentment. With that being said, the creature is an embodiment of the universal truth of how humans can be so cruel to those that are different."
5,"In Zora Neale Hurston's novel, ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" the abuse that Janie endured within all of her romantic relationships, specifically with her partner Tea Cake, propelled her journey of self-discovery and exploration further. She would not have been able to find herself and her own authentic voice without losing parts of herself along the way first. Hurston was intentional in her promotion of the following message: Good things never come easy. 

Following Tea Cake's death at the end of the novel, for the first time, Janie wills herself to both recognize and embrace the newfound solitude that was presented in front of her. Throughout the entire course of the novel, Janie was both physically and emotionally abused by all of her romantic partners, including Logan Killicks, Jody Starks, and most infamously, Tea Cake. Because she did not know any better at the time, Janie assumed that this kind of treatment was normal. It was up to her to fulfill her role as the ""dutiful"" and ""attentive"" wife that endured all of her husband's abuse, no matter how severe or emotionally scarring it may have been. 

Throughout the course of the entire story, the reader sees Janie transition from one relationship to the other, usually very quickly. It becomes apparent that she cannot handle or embrace the feeling of being alone. After she ran away from Logan, she soon met Jody, and once Jody died, she immediately came into contact with Tea Cake. But, after Tea Cake died, a switch went off in Janie's head and something drastic changed: ""Janie no longer felt the burden of being alone. Now, there was a certain light about her"" (Hurston, 134). 

Previously, Janie absolutely loathed the idea of not having a partner or living alone. However, after taking into account everything that she endured in the past year, Janie had discovered her own voice and, above all, the sheer significance and value of independence and trust. While many assume that trust is something that always has to be shared among two people in a relationship or a group of people in general, Janie came to recognize that the most important form of trust is to herself, and no one else. 

Although a cliché, everything does happen for a reason, which is yet another lesson that Janie took away and carried with her following Tea Cake's death. During the gun standoff, Janie found herself in the midst of a ""do or die situation"" where one wrong move may have cost her her life. When push came to shove, Janie did what she had to do and, for the very first time in her life, put herself first. 

While the abuse that Janie had to go through should not be wished on anyone, without having endured it, Janie would not be the woman that she grew to be at the end of the novel. There can be no light without darkness and no sun without a storm."
5,"The battle between figuring out who you are and what society wants you to be is worth fighting against. In the novel ""The Color Purple"", the author interprets the idea of a character feeling out of place within themselves and with society through her character Celie. Celie is a timid and naive woman who had to face many obstacles throughout her life, one of which includes finding her self-identity and embracing it.

When you are put into a world where you have no connections, no comfort, no knowledge of who you are as a person, it is easy to fall under the control of someone else. In the beginning of the novel, Celie was abused and mistreated by even her own family, her father. She believed the only way to make him happy was to obey and to do everything that he would ask of her. Celie was unaware of her self-worth as a woman and failed to use her power against him; she felt she had no other choice, it was a battle between a man who was both physically and mentally stronger than she could ever be. It's not to say that Celie's life of misery was due to her own fault; in fact, it goes to show the consequences that follow when you are being blinded from the world; when you have no idea of the power and control you hold within yourself.

Turning to someone can sometimes be the best strategy. Men can sometimes have a misogynistic and sexist mindset, they believe that a woman is only meant for housework and for breeding, however, when it's their turn to be put in place by a woman, they use their power of masculinity to remind them of who is in control. As for Shug Avery, this was not in her familiarity. Shug was a singer who attracted and finessed the liking of many men, including Celie's husband, who used to be her past lover. Despite the fact that Shug had no interest towards Celie, Celie admired her as a whole. She loved her body, her way of behavior, and the way she could be accepted into society, which was everything Celie wished to have. The idea of self-love and love for others was something Shug introduced to Celie. She made her aware of her own beauty as a woman and reminded her that she was beautiful and she should take advantage of it."
5,"To quantify the insidious, diabolical nature of the antebellum United States is a task too intricate and taxing to place onto any individual. In analyzing a slave's loss of belonging, one can even compromise their own psyche. However, it is often seen that those peeking back through the obscured lens of the modern period decide to engage with, define, and share the actualities of southern slavery. In this cruel, burdensome mission, these creators offer audiences the opportunity to reveal what is perhaps a time capsule of devastation decades from today, but, simultaneously, all too near. Instead of numerals and equations to calculate the travesty, however, these storytellers utilize words and syntax to revive the egregious truths of this era.

""Beloved,"" a book authored by Toni Morrison, is founded on these truths. While the narrative itself is a piece of historical fiction and explores paranormal concepts, the novel ties itself to the utter barbarism of US slavery. Yet, the audience discovers that Sethe, the protagonist, has become numb to the happenings of this aforementioned, unyielding memory, and she surrenders to its haunting of the present. With a potent, tragic telling, ""Beloved"" reveals to us a character who feels gone from herself due to her torturous servitude, her bloody murder of her daughter, and the community's banishment of her from their social circles."
5,"In the science fiction novel ""Ender's Game,"" Orson Scott Card creates the character of Ender Wiggin, an extraordinarily gifted child who feels out of place throughout most of the novel. In the novel, Ender Wiggin is born into a dystopian society where the government keeps control through the fear of the alien race known as ""buggers,"" who attacked the earth nearly a century ago. The government keeps its eyes on gifted children through a ""monitor,"" allowing them to see the children's perspective, including their thoughts and emotions.

At the age of six, Ender is taken into the International Fleet, the army built to keep earth 'safe' from the buggers. There, he is put in battle school, and because of his unusual way of processing his reality, he is isolated from his classmates. He becomes even further isolated by Colonel Graff, who specifically favors the boy to keep him isolated. As he moves through the ranks much sooner than he should, he becomes progressively more isolated as the youngest and most inexperienced in classes.

Card continuously uses this isolation, this feeling of being out of place, to shape Ender, both into what the fleet wants: a genius military commander, but also into a child who will always have empathy for those who are trodden on. Eventually, this highlights one of the novel's central themes: that the only way an enemy can be destroyed is through a full understanding of that enemy."
5,"In ""The Metamorphosis"" by Franz Kafka, the author portrays a situation where the characters experience a sudden change in their circumstances. As a result, they feel rejected and out of place in their new positions in society. This leads to the deterioration of relationships and ultimately, loss of life. These ideas can be interpreted through a Freudian lens, and they also reflect Kafka's own life experiences.

The main character, Gregor, wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a bug. This new body prevents him from communicating effectively and fulfilling his role as the sole provider for his family. As soon as his family discovers his transformation, they distance themselves from him and make their disdain towards him evident. Gregor's inability to communicate renders him useless, and he realizes that he no longer has a place in the common areas of the house. Consequently, he isolates himself in his room.

The countless hours spent alone only intensify Gregor's feelings of loneliness. Moreover, the growing resentment from his family confirms to him that he will never fit in again. As a result, his mental state rapidly deteriorates. The lack of attention and care he receives from his once loving sister pushes him over the edge.

This scenario in ""The Metamorphosis"" can be seen as a reflection of Kafka's own experiences. Kafka often felt like an outsider in society, and he struggled with his own sense of belonging. This theme is evident in many of his works, including ""The Metamorphosis."" Through Gregor's transformation and subsequent rejection, Kafka explores the feelings of alienation and the impact it can have on an individual's mental well-being.

From a Freudian perspective, Gregor's transformation can be seen as a manifestation of his repressed desires and frustrations. The bug symbolizes his suppressed emotions and the inability to express himself fully. The rejection and isolation he experiences mirror the feelings of rejection and isolation that Kafka himself may have felt in his own life.

In conclusion, ""The Metamorphosis"" by Franz Kafka portrays a scenario where the characters' sudden change in circumstances leads to feelings of rejection and alienation. This deterioration of relationships ultimately results in loss of life. These ideas can be interpreted through a Freudian lens and reflect Kafka's own experiences with societal rejection. Through Gregor's transformation, Kafka explores the themes of alienation and the impact it can have on an individual's mental well-being."
5,"Ever since the very creation of the United States of America as an independent nation, American women have been fighting for the advancement of their rights. Whether it be decades ago at the Seneca Falls Convention to further women's voting rights, or more recently within Roe v. Wade deciding the rights and privacy of women in the medical field, there has always been a fight to achieve better rights and, thus, better lives for women. Even through the decades of fighting, though, women have been and always will be at a disadvantage due to the strict expectations of society.

In her novel, The Awakening, Kate Chopin explores this very idea of women struggling as a result of societal norms. Specifically, Edna Pontellier, the protagonist of the riveting story, feels incredibly out of place in society as she awakens to find her independence and creativity. Through her use of complex character analogies, as well as a prominent symbol throughout the story, Chopin makes a bold statement for her time that women, like Edna herself, who feel out of place and must struggle through obstacles to feel truly happy, are essentially placed in shackles of persecution by society's rigid roles and expectations.

Chopin's use of character analogies allows the reader to understand the depth of Edna's struggle. Edna is compared to a caged bird, trapped and unable to fully spread her wings and fly. This analogy emphasizes the restrictions placed upon women in society, as well as the longing for freedom and independence. Edna's desire to break free from societal expectations is further exemplified through her relationship with Robert Lebrun. Robert represents the freedom and passion that Edna craves, but their relationship is ultimately doomed by societal norms. This tragic portrayal highlights the consequences women face when they dare to challenge the status quo.

Additionally, Chopin employs a prominent symbol throughout the story to convey the theme of societal oppression. The ocean serves as a symbol of freedom and escape for Edna. It represents the vast possibilities and limitless potential that lie beyond the confines of society. However, the ocean also poses a threat, as it can be overwhelming and dangerous. This duality reflects the risks women face when they defy societal expectations. While the ocean offers liberation, it also presents the possibility of isolation and destruction.

Through her exploration of Edna's struggle, Chopin sheds light on the plight of women in a society that restricts their freedom and stifles their individuality. Edna's journey serves as a powerful reminder that women should not be confined to predetermined roles and expectations. They deserve the opportunity to pursue their own happiness and fulfillment, free from the judgment and persecution of society.

In conclusion, Kate Chopin's novel, The Awakening, delves into the struggles faced by women in a society that imposes rigid roles and expectations. Through her use of character analogies and a prominent symbol, Chopin emphasizes the challenges women like Edna Pontellier face as they strive for independence and happiness. The novel serves as a call to action, urging society to recognize and dismantle the shackles of persecution that confine women. Only then can women truly awaken to their full potential and lead lives of fulfillment and freedom."
5,"At some point or other, it is inevitable that each individual will carry a sense with them that they do not belong, perhaps not anywhere; this is just human nature. Likewise, in literature, many characters initially have a sense that they fail to belong, and then over the course of the novel, the character morphs into a more self-confident individual who has created a place for themselves. Interestingly, in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, the opposite occurs.

Victor Frankenstein's Creature initially feels relatively content with the life he leads the first few years after his ""birth""; however, upon learning about families and relationships, as well as realizing that, unless a companion is created for him, he will fail to experience these joys, the Creature grows incredibly wary of those around him. His entire viewpoint towards life switches from relative contentedness to contempt and a feeling that he does not belong.

Throughout her novel, Mary Shelley employs the Creature's sense of being drastically out of place in an attempt to relay her argument regarding the importance of maintaining familial relationships, as well as her argument regarding the destructive effects of knowledge for the sake of one's ego."
5,"The main character in ""The Metamorphosis"" by Franz Kafka turns into a hideous vermin overnight, unbeknownst to the world, including his family. Because his life is turned upside down and he is stuck in this unfamiliar bug body, during this alienating and confusing time, Gregor is isolated from the world. He is confined to his room, away from his work, life, and family because he is out of place as a creature that is no longer human and connected to society. This experience of feeling out of place negatively affects Gregor's mental health and life, yet enriches Gregor's meaning of life as he reflects on his life as a human.

Through this alienating experience, he realizes that his life is passionless, and he lived to provide for his family, more like a servant than a son, working himself to death, yet never reaping the rewards. This illuminates the work as a whole as Gregor's epiphany conveys Kafka's commentary that society pressures humans to work endlessly to their death to gain status and money, to the point where living as an isolated, loveless, and lifeless vermin would lead a life just as unfulfilling and meaningless."
5,"In the novel ""Purple Hibiscus"" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the protagonist Kambili is faced with the challenge of questioning the values she was raised with. Kambili comes from a wealthy Nigerian family that is deeply religious, particularly her father Eugene, who helps those in need in the name of Jesus. However, Eugene's religious beliefs become a source of tension within their community when he uses his religion to justify the abuse and control he exerts over his family.

It is during a trip to her aunt Ifeoma's family that Kambili begins to see a different way of life. For the first time, she experiences a more relaxed and open family dynamic, and she also reconnects with her Nigerian roots that her father had shielded her from. Among her relatives and within the Igbo Nigerian culture, Kambili feels like an outsider. This feeling of not belonging forces her to question the values she has been raised with.

The central theme of the novel emerges as Kambili realizes that blindly adhering to the values she was raised with is not the right path. She learns that it is important to differentiate between right and wrong, even if it means going against the beliefs instilled in her from a young age. Kambili's journey towards self-discovery and independence is a powerful exploration of the human capacity to challenge and redefine one's own values.

Through Kambili's experiences, Adichie highlights the importance of critical thinking and the ability to question the values one is raised with. It is not enough to simply accept what has been taught without considering its moral implications. Kambili's journey serves as a reminder that true growth and understanding come from challenging the status quo and embracing one's own identity.

In conclusion, ""Purple Hibiscus"" explores the theme of breaking free from the values one is raised with. Kambili's journey towards self-discovery and independence serves as a powerful reminder that blindly following the beliefs instilled in us can lead to injustice and unhappiness. Adichie's novel encourages readers to question and challenge the values they have been raised with, in order to find their own path and create a more just and fulfilling life."
5,"1984 is a story about Winston, a member of the Outer Party in Oceania. The Outer Party holds a higher rank than the common citizens but is still below the Inner Party, which governs Oceania. Winston is under constant surveillance by the government, causing him to feel out of place. He becomes associated with Julia, another Outer Party member, and attends an assembly where O'Brien encourages hatred towards Goldstein, a former party member.

Living in a society that is deeply rooted in a specific ideology, Winston gradually feels more disconnected from Oceania. This feeling intensifies as he realizes that his attempts to rebel against the government are futile. Despite his efforts, he is unable to bring about any significant change.

This novel serves as a reminder that not everything will work out perfectly in the end. It highlights the fact that one person alone cannot always bring about the desired change in society. Winston's struggle against the oppressive government showcases the limitations of individual power and the overwhelming control exerted by the ruling party.

In conclusion, 1984 portrays Winston's journey as a member of the Outer Party in Oceania. His constant surveillance and association with Julia and O'Brien lead him to question the society he lives in. However, despite his efforts to overthrow the government, he ultimately fails. This serves as a powerful reminder that individual actions may not always be enough to challenge and change an entire society."
5,"As the Second World War came to its close, the world had tasted its share of dystopia from a variety of cruelly authoritarian dictators. Many of the world's citizens felt themselves wedged—both physically and ideologically—between the two political extremes that induced this frightening period of history.

In this time, George Orwell published his novel 1984 as a commentary on the realities of societies founded on such extremism. The protagonist of his novel, Winston Smith, a bureaucratic word for the Party's reality-altering Ministry of Truth, models the typical ""everyman"" meant to garner sympathy from the reader. 

As Winston begins to find himself out of place in the controlled, conformist society regulated by the Party, Orwell explores his intense emotions, unorthodox resulting actions, and ultimately consequences at the hands of the Party. Through this, Orwell develops a message emphasizing the importance of embracing self-expression in one's pursuit of individual happiness and freedom."
5,"Times of romance and love, the perfect marriage and love match, these themes encapsulate most of the fiction that explores this time period. Jane Austen and others seem to be favored with their happy love stories, recants of city balls, and tales of high society. However, this does not entail the entire reality of young ladies during this time. ""Jane Eyre"" stands apart from these other novels with a deeper sense of reality and true character growth.

Her youth was not filled with dancing lessons, and her 'mother' did not raise her with the hopes of marrying for true love and living happily ever after. Instead, she was tortured, misunderstood, and completely neglected. Instead of breaking her, however, this original disconnect from society proves extremely valuable to her character growth. Jane Eyre, although lacking in connection and extremely distant from her peers, grows through these disabilities to find a healthy relationship and contentment through her vocation in life."
5,"In music, the rules of what notes can be used in a melody are dictated by the key signature. This key signature acts as a guide or outline to what notes must be changed in order to adhere to the structure of the other pitches around that note. If a key is placed into a melody or harmony and it is not found in the key signature, often times the result is that the note will stick out like a sore thumb, as it is so obviously out of place in comparison to the pitches around it.

A literary work that is similar to this idea would be J.D. Salinger's <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, which details the journey of Holden Caulfield. Like a note not in the key signature, Holden feels out of place as he battles his inner strife of adhering to social expectations while getting older. Salinger includes Holden's experiences while at school as well as in the city that illuminate how out of place Holden is, ultimately suggesting that maturing includes the exploration of the unknown and that child-like innocence cannot be preserved."
5,"There is no greater loneliness than being the only member of one's race and knowing there is no one else like you in the world. In addition to this, not a single person that you have met on your journey has shown you a bit of compassion once they see you for what you are. In Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" the Creature is brought to life by Victor Frankenstein and immediately abandoned out of fear and disgust at his appearance. Victor meddled with forces far beyond his control but refused to deal with the consequences of his actions. As a result, he abandoned his child and left him to barely survive on his own.

The Creature journeys across Europe, trying to find his creator, and when Victor continues to neglect him, he begins to kill the people closest to Victor. Victor's constant neglect and alienation of his creation and the consequences that followed are proof that parents of any kind owe compassion and family to their children and are responsible for whatever results occur if they fail to do so.

In ""Frankenstein,"" the Creature is not only abandoned by his creator but also rejected by society. He is left to navigate the world alone, without any guidance or support. This sense of isolation is intensified by the fact that he is the only one of his kind. The Creature longs for companionship and understanding, but instead, he is met with fear and disgust. This lack of compassion from others only deepens his loneliness and fuels his anger.

Victor Frankenstein, as the creator of the Creature, has a responsibility to care for and nurture his creation. However, he fails to fulfill this duty. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, Victor abandons the Creature, leaving him to fend for himself. This act of neglect has severe consequences, as the Creature seeks revenge on Victor by killing those closest to him. Victor's refusal to acknowledge his role as a parent and his constant neglect of the Creature ultimately leads to tragedy.

This serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of compassion and responsibility in parenting. Regardless of the circumstances of a child's creation, parents have a duty to provide love, support, and guidance. When this duty is neglected, the consequences can be devastating. In the case of Victor Frankenstein, his failure to show compassion and take responsibility for his creation leads to the destruction of those he holds dear.

In conclusion, the loneliness experienced by the Creature in ""Frankenstein"" highlights the importance of compassion and family. Victor Frankenstein's neglect and abandonment of his creation demonstrate the consequences that can arise when parents fail to fulfill their responsibilities. This serves as a reminder that parents, regardless of the circumstances, owe compassion and family to their children and are accountable for the outcomes that result from their actions or lack thereof."
5,"In the early 20th century, women had very few choices. At their fathers' requests, not their own, they were often married off and forced to submit to the life-long duties of mother, wife, and homemaker without ever choosing that path for themselves. Those that found themselves unmarried past the spinster age of 25 often became schoolteachers, earning scraps of wages at a thankless job. Few women found ways to escape this societal expectation, and those that did often felt very out of place in society.

In the novel, ""The Color Purple"" by Alice Walker, one such character who feels out of place in society because of her refusal to conform to its expectations for women is Shug Avery, a local celebrity with a reputation for disregarding others. Shug's experience throughout the novel of feeling out of place in society but eventually allowing herself to be loved, leads her to find a sense of belonging which helps prove that to love and be loved is human nature and is integral to one's happiness.

Shug Avery is introduced as a woman who defies societal norms. She is unapologetically herself, refusing to conform to the expectations placed upon her as a woman. This defiance makes her an outcast in society, as she is seen as a threat to the traditional roles and expectations of women. Shug's refusal to conform is evident in her relationships with men. She refuses to be tied down to one man, instead choosing to have multiple partners. This behavior is seen as scandalous and immoral, further isolating her from society.

Despite her reputation, Shug is a complex character who longs for love and acceptance. She is not content with the superficial relationships she has with men, and she yearns for a deeper connection. This desire for love and acceptance is what ultimately leads her to form a bond with Celie, the novel's protagonist. Through their relationship, Shug is able to find the love and acceptance she has been searching for.

Shug's journey towards finding a sense of belonging is a powerful testament to the importance of love and acceptance in one's life. It shows that even those who are seen as outcasts can find happiness and fulfillment when they allow themselves to be loved. Shug's refusal to conform to societal expectations ultimately leads her to a place of self-acceptance and happiness.

In conclusion, Shug Avery's experience in ""The Color Purple"" highlights the struggles faced by women in the early 20th century who refused to conform to societal expectations. Her journey towards finding love and acceptance proves that to love and be loved is human nature and is integral to one's happiness. Shug's story serves as a reminder that it is important to embrace our true selves and not let society dictate our worth."
5,"In the work of ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, the ideas of faith, justice, punishment, and redemption all play a large role in establishing the critiques and observations of life. These ideas are either made by the author himself or have been found throughout his work by others. 

The novel follows the young mother, Hester Prynne, as she raises her young daughter, Pearl, who was born out of wedlock. The reader witnesses as Hester is ostracized and exiled from her community, and how the aftereffects of her sin of adultery collide with more than just her. 

As her secret lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, the young minister, experiences the moral and emotional turmoil of the secrecy of his involvement in the affair, it affects his relationship with his role in the church and his place before God. The physical weakness that accompanies his guilt adds to the overwhelming feeling of being out of place in so many areas of his life. This not only changes the direction his life goes but also plays a significant role in the plot of the work as a whole."
5,"Adolescence is a time characterized by conflict between personal identity and the role one is expected to play in society. Being out of sync with one's peers, whether due to late development or differing viewpoints, can lead to social isolation and despair if left unaddressed. In the novel ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J.D. Salinger, the protagonist Holden Caulfield finds himself out of place in society. Holden's fixation on childhood innocence and his intense fear of growing up and entering a world of insincere adults contribute to his social isolation, depression, and suicidal thoughts. However, as the story progresses, Holden begins to find hope and slowly discovers the possibility of making a place for himself. His journey from isolated despair to hope exemplifies the novel's message of moving on, growing up, persevering, and defying societal expectations.

Holden's struggle with finding his place in society is evident throughout the novel. He feels disconnected from his peers, who seem to be moving forward in life while he remains stuck in a state of adolescence. This disconnect leads to his social isolation and a sense of despair. Holden's fixation on childhood innocence further exacerbates his feelings of being out of place. He longs for a world where people are genuine and sincere, but he sees only phoniness and hypocrisy in the adult world. This fear of growing up and becoming like the insincere adults he despises contributes to his isolation and depression.

Holden's journey towards hope begins when he meets his sister Phoebe, who represents the innocence and purity he longs for. Through his interactions with Phoebe, Holden begins to see the possibility of finding a place for himself in the world. He realizes that he cannot remain in a state of perpetual adolescence and that he must confront the challenges of adulthood. This realization marks a turning point in Holden's journey, as he starts to understand the importance of moving on and growing up.

As the novel progresses, Holden's perspective begins to shift. He starts to see the potential for authenticity and sincerity in the adult world, despite its flaws. This newfound hope allows him to envision a future where he can make a place for himself, even if it means defying societal expectations. Holden's journey from isolated despair to hope illustrates the novel's message of resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" explores the conflict between personal identity and societal expectations during adolescence. Holden Caulfield's experience of being out of place in society due to his fixation on childhood innocence and fear of growing up highlights the challenges faced by many adolescents. However, Holden's journey from isolated despair to hope demonstrates the importance of moving on, growing up, and making a place for oneself despite societal expectations. The novel serves as a reminder that resilience and perseverance can lead to personal growth and a sense of belonging in the world."
6,"In the novel ""The Awakening"", by Kate Chopin, the protagonist Edna Pontellier feels greatly out of place in her societal role as mother, wife, and creative creature. This tension between her desire for independence and the context in which she finds herself contributes greatly to her change as a character throughout the novel and her crisis point at the end of it, and is ultimately integral to the novel's conflicts and its themes of radical independence and the feeling of suffocation and frustration under societal repression and expectation.

To begin with, Edna feels repressed and unsatisfied with her current romantic and sexual relationship with her husband. Her interactions with him throughout the novel are cold and increasingly frictional as the novel goes on. She and her husband have trouble relating to each other, and once Edna begins to explore her newfound sense of freedom by avoiding certain social functions and taking time out of her day for activities such as painting, he admonishes her. At the same time as she feels no warmth toward her husband, Edna feels a great romantic attraction to a man named Robert, and when Robert leaves for Mexico to avoid causing too much tension by being seen with Edna, she settles for an extramarital affair with a man named Alcee Arobin, which causes some gossip and disapproval among her social circle, partially because he is known as being unserious. Even the doctor in the novel, who is generally at least understanding of Edna's eccentricities, hopes that she is not having an affair with Arobin. In this way, Edna's experience of feeling out of place as a wife contributes to her growing sense throughout the novel that one should have the ability to choose who one loves, which comes into some conflict with the difficulty of enacting this within the societal constraints of her time. This, in turn, exemplifies the human need for some level of independence (and some of the consequences of it), as well as the frustration with common social mores evidenced throughout the novel.

Edna is also uncomfortable with her familial and, essentially, occupational role as a caretaker. While she does love her two children, she has difficulty relating to them and finds it tiresome and often not worth it to attend to their every need. Unlike some of her friends, who are comfortable and happy in the role of a ""mother-woman,"" Edna finds it uncomfortable, exhausting, and frequently incomprehensible. It is hinted throughout the novel that to some extent she regrets that, having had children, she now has an obligation to devote her life to them. She even expresses this when she says that she would die for her children but not give up her life for them. Edna's out-of-place feeling of intense obligation and some exhaustion with her role as a mother, as well as the way that she describes the role as something different from mere womanhood - being a ""mother-woman,"" leads her to more and more independent actions and open rejections of her role (such as acknowledging her happiness when her children go to New York for a vacation), and contributes to the themes of independence and societal repression and expectation by showing that certain social obligations, even arguably positive ones like motherhood, can take away one's full life and humanity.

Throughout the novel, Edna takes steps to establish herself as separate from her societal role, such as moving out of her house. Ultimately, however, Edna cannot bring herself to completely reject all societal customs that pain her, or at least to do so and live with that decision. When she perceives that she must choose between living with Robert and her obligations to be a good mother to her children, she cannot bring herself to choose and instead drowns trying to swim out to sea. This shows how Edna's desire for independence eventually consumes her entire being and leads her to reject a world that will not let her free herself from all obligation. In this way, the ultimate message of Edna's character, and to some extent the story as a whole, is a certain level of despair at the idea of meaningfully reconciling the potentially infinite human desire for independence that Edna feels and the place in society in which she found herself.

Whether as a mother or partner, Edna continually finds herself feeling out of place throughout ""The Awakening"", and while she eventually finds the stress of her position too much to bear, her feelings of isolation and incongruity eventually reveal the novel's main message about the persistent conflict between independence and social and societal obligation, and the ways in which that conflict was particularly stifling and overwhelming for 19th-century women like Edna."
6,"Essay: The Absurdities of the Military in Catch-22

Everybody is treated equally in the army. Same outfits, same training, same gravestones. Obviously, none of that is functionally true, but that's the sentiment often given by war novels and movies. To be a soldier is a brave and noble thing; it means risking one's life for their country and dying an honorable death. Catch-22 is a book that stomps all over this sentiment, painting the military as an absurdly unfair, exploitative, and cruel system. Its messaging is highlighted by its protagonist, a young man named Yossarian.

Yossarian is a contrarian by nature, often finding ridiculous ways to get out of following orders or pulling insane stunts to try and be sent home. He's in sharp contrast to many of the men around him, most of whom are either freshly 18 or actual children, who do as they're told and keep their heads down. Yossarian's insistence on being out of place in the army is what makes Catch-22 effective as a piece of satire as it highlights the absurdities of the military.

Yossarian doesn't want to fly any more missions. The number of missions he needs to go on keeps raising, and he just wants to go home. His methods of trying to avoid flying his missions are often humorous, but his rebellious attitude puts in focus how predatory this whole system really is. Everyone except Yossarian keeps flying their missions, risking their lives on every one because they're told it's the right thing to do. The people in charge are willing to let them die if it means making them look good, and they themselves are willing to die if they're instructed to.

Yossarian is a little older than a lot of the men he works with, being 28 compared to a lot of kids of 18 and even younger. Yossarian's eager preservation of his own life makes light of how these men are throwing their lives away for practically nothing, just because it was crammed into their heads that they're doing something noble or glorious. It's horrifying to see that Yossarian is the only one willing to take drastic measures to protect himself and how he's seen as an outcast and a lunatic for doing so. Yossarian not wanting to die at the hands of the majors and generals that keep trying to take advantage of him is unpatriotic and a danger to the whole system. Why is the whole system based on taking advantage of people who don't know any better? Isn't Yossarian the only reasonable one here?

Yossarian cares deeply about other people, and that's a quality unique to him and only a few other characters in the book. He's incredibly affected by the death of another soldier, Snowden, and this death haunts him throughout the entire book. He sees this young man's blood on his hands, and he feels the weight of his death every second he's up in the sky, knowing he could so easily meet the same fate. For comparison, another soldier named Milo goes to Snowden's funeral and spends about two lines grieving his death before transitioning into talking about himself and how he can make more money. An individual person's death isn't important in war, it just isn't. Yossarian being so concerned with one person or another dying is unusual. Everyone else is used to the idea of death, completely desensitized to it after seeing it so often. But of course, the reader feels for Yossarian and recognizes the horror of death being treated so lightly by everyone in the book. Of course, every person's life matters, why are they acting like it's not a big deal? Yossarian being so avoidant of death makes him a bad soldier, but it makes him a character that's easily sympathized with and a mirror that reveals how cruel the military can be.

Yossarian is horribly out of place in the military and desperately tries to find a way out of his duties again and again. The fact that he's so disillusioned with the system is what makes Catch-22's satire land, being told from the point of view of someone who doesn't believe in the propaganda he's been fed about war. He gives an outsider's perspective while still being fully entrenched in the horrors of the military. Catch-22 wouldn't work without Yossarian, and Yossarian couldn't exist as a character if he wasn't exposed to such an absurd and exploitative system."
6,"When the game of lying gets taken out of context or taken too far, the consequences can be deadly. White lies can turn into a spiraling web of lies that make something innocent look deceitful. On the more severe side of lying, holding in a lie can cause the heart or morals, everything that one stands for, to be their dying proclamation.

In Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter,"" he uses symbolism and allusion to the Bible through the character of Dimmesdale to represent how static morals and traits can be changed. The character of Dimmesdale can be described as a puritan Atlas, carrying the whole town of Salem and its secrets on his back. Dimmesdale is represented through the colors white and black. The white stands for innocence and purity, and the black for sins and darkness. Knowing the secrets that he holds, he hides away from the community, keeping his thoughts, words, and actions locked up, only for them to resurface and boil over.

The color symbolism also appears with the brand on his chest, the red A. The red signifies the bond of blood and love. He is bonded by blood to Hester through Pearl and, in doing so, has found love for both of them. The symbolism of him branding himself with the A stands for the burden he carries and the secrets he holds dear to his heart as well.

The allusion to the Bible comes with Dimmesdale's character and the A he brands into his chest. One of the long-standing sins of Christianity is committing adultery. The burden around his heart acts as a punishment by God for the sins he has committed. This breaks Dimmesdale down, causing him to lose a part of his faith and his morals, as he believes that God is punishing him by tempting his fate. Dimmesdale, until the burden was lifted off his chest, felt out of place, both in his moral standings and in the community, by having ties to the ""wretched"" Hester and ""spawn of the devil"" Pearl.

At the end of the novel, his character traits change. Instead of hiding from Hester, he wants to be free with her. He throws away the oath he swore to the church and wants peace in his life for once, away from the all-knowing eye of the church. His death also symbolizes the cleansing of his sins, as well as Hester's. This is also alluding to the Bible, as it references the crucifixion of Christ and how his death forgave the sins of all.

Through lying, the very traits that make up one's personality can be changed. Whether it's the mask that someone puts up finally coming crashing down or they change to match what they believe is right, the character of Dimmesdale changes both morally and character-wise. He goes from being a morally static figure to being more morally fluid as his beliefs change as a result of the events in ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne."
6,"In ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" the protagonist Chief Bromden often felt out of place in the ward. A tall, half-Native man, Chief was a chronic patient at a psychiatric ward for having schizophrenic hallucinations. While sometimes referred to as more of a rehabilitation center, the ward practiced abusive 'treatment' strategies such as manipulation, shock therapy, and even lobotomies.

Chief was an observer, and throughout the book, Chief describes a fog that passes through the ward consistently. Symbolically, this fog represented a blanket-like safety the patients felt in the ward. Despite this, the fog was not a place of safety at all. By existing in this fog, the patients ran the risk of fogging their minds and their judgment. With the fog comes the necessity to trust a system that cannot be trusted.

Although he was tall, Chief always felt smaller than he was. The psychiatric system and other patients convinced him that he was dumb and deaf. He kept this facade up publicly, yet deep down, Chief knew that there was something inherently wrong although there wasn't anything he could do. Although some characters sometimes displayed similar feelings, the difference lies in the attitudes of the other patients. Many of the Acutes, or short-term patients, were there on their own accord. Yet toward the beginning of the book, ward patient Harding claims that because they can't do anything, it would be best to live their lives like rabbits in their own Disney World like they prey he felt they were."
6,"The 1930s and 1940s were a time period in which the world experienced the rise of dictators. Among these dictators were Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, both determined to establish totalitarian regimes where everyone shared the same beliefs and acted in the same manner. They aimed to achieve this through mass propaganda and brainwashing. In Nazi Germany, political dissidents were either sent to concentration camps or simply killed, while in Stalinist Russia, they were sent to Gulags or executed. In both countries, citizens could not trust each other, as anyone could be a spy and report them to the authorities. Consequently, everyone conformed to the same thoughts and behaviors, resulting in a homogenous society.

It was during this time period, with the genuine fear of totalitarianism, that greatly influenced George Orwell in his writing of ""1984."" In this novel, the protagonist, Winston Smith, is considered a thought criminal simply for having different thoughts than the Party and the people around him. Consequently, he must always be cautious about what he says and to whom he speaks, leading him to isolate himself from society in order to protect himself.

Through Winston and ""1984,"" Orwell conveys the message that having different ideologies in society, even in the present day, causes individuals to self-alienate from society. This can lead to further isolation and potentially drive people to commit crimes, as they feel out of place and oppressed by society."
6,"In the novel, ""Beloved,"" written by Toni Morrison, the author narrates a moving story about the depth of love and motherhood in captivity. The book is dedicated to the millions of lives who were affected by slavery. Sethe and her four children managed to escape their plantation called ""Sweet Home"" and start a new life in their new community and home, number 124.

However, just one month later, their owner named schoolteacher arrived at their house to take back what he believed was his property. Faced with the prospect of her children being taken back to Sweet Home, Sethe makes the difficult decision to kill her children and then herself. This act of desperation and possession secludes and shames Sethe from the rest of the black community, especially after she successfully manages to kill her youngest daughter.

But it is not only Sethe who becomes outcast; her entire family is also left isolated and disapproved of by the rest of the community. They have to grow up in isolation, facing the disapproval of others. Toni Morrison's novel, ""Beloved,"" explores how the oppression and trauma inflicted onto slaves affected each individual differently. It also delves into how the censorship and societal standards attempt to hide the deep shame and anguish, further alienating those who are unable to conform.

In ""Beloved,"" Morrison skillfully portrays the complex emotions and struggles faced by Sethe and her family. Sethe's decision to kill her children is a desperate act of love and protection, driven by the fear of them being subjected to the horrors of slavery once again. However, this act goes against the societal norms and expectations, leading to her isolation and condemnation.

The black community, while understanding the pain and trauma endured by Sethe, cannot fully accept her actions. They are bound by the standards and censorship imposed by society, which dictate that such acts are unacceptable. This creates a divide between Sethe and the rest of the community, leaving her and her family in a state of isolation and disapproval.

Morrison's exploration of this theme highlights the deep shame and anguish experienced by those who are unable to conform to societal expectations. Sethe's act of killing her child is a reflection of the extreme trauma and oppression she has endured as a slave. However, society's inability to acknowledge and address this trauma further alienates and isolates those who have suffered.

In conclusion, ""Beloved"" by Toni Morrison is a powerful novel that delves into the depths of love and motherhood in the context of slavery. It explores how the oppression and trauma inflicted onto slaves affected each individual differently. The novel also sheds light on the censorship and societal standards that attempt to hide the deep shame and anguish experienced by those who are unable to conform. Through her poignant storytelling, Morrison brings to light the complexities of human emotions and the lasting impact of slavery on individuals and communities."
6,"In Albert Camus' ""The Stranger,"" Meursault struggles with finding meaning in life and understanding the appropriate social standards and conducts in French society, taking for granted his autonomy. In the first half of the book, Meursault ""goes through the motions"" of his life, feeling nothing for his mother's death and experiencing only sensations in the activities he engages with, whether that be the heat of his mother's funeral procession or the breeze on the beach he frequents with Marie. Only through experiencing the boredom of prison, the bureaucracy of the French legal system, and the extremist views of the religious chaplain does Meursault finally express his emotion. Ultimately, Meursault's identity as a social outcast and his growth throughout experiencing the oppression of various apparatus in French society allow him to come to cherish pre-prison experiences. Although Meursault's unique personality is responsible for his own decisions that portray himself as a villain in French society, Camus suggests that it's the apparatus (legal system, prison, religious intolerance) that acts as the real villain in ""The Stranger,"" unwilling and unable to provide the aid and resources for those like Meursault that are misunderstood and out of place in society."
6,"Feeling out of place in a world where everything and everyone seems to be in opposition towards oneself is one of the pinnacle struggles of humans in society in today's social climate. People are often ridiculed for their differences, ostracized for not participating in what is socially acceptable, and even labeled as deviant for attributes that they cannot control. This is especially true for Gregor Samsa, the protagonist of the absurdist novella, ""The Metamorphosis"" by Franz Kafka. Through the ordeal of dealing with the adversities of being transformed into a large insect, Gregor is separated socially and physically from the people he loves, while Kafka embarks on attempting to discern the philosophical argument of rejecting those that are out of place in society or attempting to facilitate them to a greater level of self-achievement.

In ""The Metamorphosis,"" the feeling of being out of place affects Gregor in a way that makes him perceive his own self as a hideous creature to others. People see his physical appearance, which contributes to the work as a whole through the central philosophical argument of rejecting those who are out of place to improve one's own potential or accepting them yet limiting oneself's potential.

Gregor's transformation into an insect symbolizes his alienation from society. He becomes a grotesque creature that is repulsive to others, causing them to reject him. This rejection is not only physical but also emotional. Gregor's family, who were once dependent on him, now view him as a burden and treat him with disgust. They isolate him in his room, refusing to acknowledge his existence. This isolation further deepens Gregor's feelings of being out of place and intensifies his struggle to find acceptance.

Kafka uses Gregor's transformation as a metaphor for the human experience of feeling out of place in society. He explores the themes of identity, belonging, and the inherent cruelty of human nature. Through Gregor's perspective, Kafka challenges the reader to question the societal norms that dictate who is accepted and who is rejected. He forces us to confront our own biases and prejudices, and to consider the consequences of excluding those who do not fit into our preconceived notions of what is ""normal.""

The novella also raises the question of whether it is better to reject those who are out of place or to facilitate their integration into society. Gregor's family initially tries to hide him from the outside world, ashamed of his transformation. However, as the story progresses, they begin to rely on him for financial support. This shift in their attitude suggests that accepting those who are different can lead to personal growth and a greater understanding of oneself.

In conclusion, ""The Metamorphosis"" explores the universal struggle of feeling out of place in society. Through Gregor's transformation into an insect, Kafka delves into the philosophical argument of rejecting those who are different or attempting to facilitate their integration. The novella challenges us to question our own prejudices and biases, and to consider the consequences of excluding those who do not fit into societal norms. Ultimately, Kafka suggests that accepting and embracing those who are out of place can lead to personal growth and a more inclusive society."
6,"In the novel ""Things Fall Apart"", by Chinua Achebe, the character Nwoye struggles with his own identity within his tribe and copes with his feelings of alienation by finding religion. The novel is set in a village in Africa as it is colonized by Western men. It follows Okonkwo, a leader in this tribe, as he falls from grace when his character flaws catch up with him. He has a fraught relationship with his son, Nwoye, as Okonkwo's idea of traditional masculinity conflicts with Nwoye's feelings and later behaviors.

Nwoye feels alienated from his tribe when the traditions leave him without his friend, Ikemefuna, who is killed in ritual sacrifice by Okonkwo, and he is forced to question these traditions. When the missionaries arrive, he finds that their Christian religion makes more sense to him than the tribe's traditions, and he eventually converts, severing his relationship with his father. Through Nwoye's feelings of isolation, Achebe develops the idea of how alienation from one's community can have extremely negative psychological implications on a character, and how missionaries used these doubts about tradition to convert people to their religion, leading to the destruction of the tribal culture."
6,"The feeling of loneliness is something that likely every human who has existed, and will exist, has felt in some capacity. It is safe to say that no one enjoys this feeling; most can barely tolerate it. This is why humans form communities, clubs, and social groups, as many cannot tolerate the feeling of being alone or out of their element. However, what if one felt like this for weeks, months, maybe even years? In essence, that person would be nearly identical to the character of Holden in ""The Catcher in the Rye"" as written by J.D. Salinger.

Holden, in the novel, feels as though he doesn't belong anywhere. His mental health issues plague him from seeking help, and his desire for innocence and the desire to remain young and free of worries isolate him from his peers. Loss and grief keep Holden in his socially outcast state, in which he experiences the crushing loneliness from his peers, his family, and his mind. This makes him feel constantly out of place and contributes to the theme of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" in that at some point, everyone has to grow up, even if they get harmed along the way."
6,"Countless novels' plots are sparked with the idea of the misplaced person. Stories of orphans, those with unique abilities, or simply societal underdogs are anything but uncommon. These stories frequently end with a triumph over the metaphorical chains which once held them, but they always make a commentary about how individuals fit into greater society. Kurt Vonnegut's Vietnam war-era novel, ""Slaughterhouse 5,"" explores the story of Billy Pilgrim who, as his name suggests, is a man on a journey. He is also, however, completely isolated from what surrounds him. Not only is he separated from ""normal"" society, but from the entire typical construct of time. 

In ""Slaughterhouse 5,"" author Kurt Vonnegut includes character on character conflicts berating Billy Pilgrim and removes Billy from a typical timeline in a direct narration of events to make the novel's central point that not everything is what it seems to be and one should never stop asking questions about their environment."
6,"In the novel ""Frankenstein"" by Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein's monstrous creation experiences a sense of displacement and rejection within his surroundings. He is deemed too different to be accepted by society, which leads to negative interactions and ultimately shapes his lack of empathy and impulsive behavior. Fueled by a deep hatred for the cruel world he inhabits, the monster embarks on a vengeful quest to destroy his creator's life, blaming him for his wretched existence. The monster's experiences of alienation and disdain prompt a critical examination of the novel as a whole. One can argue that Victor's relentless pursuit of scientific knowledge makes him the true monster, as he fails to recognize the humanity in his creation and perpetuates its isolation and suffering."
6,"Our past faults and experiences can make us feel out of place in the present community, culture, and world at large that we inhabit. Although what we have been through is inescapable and cannot be reduced to something that is long gone, it can influence how we proceed in the world and impact the lives and experiences of others.

In Victor Hugo's ""Les Miserables,"" Hugo examines how the past can isolate people from the world they live in with his protagonist Jean Valjean, who is persecuted for stealing a loaf of bread. When Valjean evades his parole officer and attempts to live life uninhibited by his criminal self, he constantly comes into conflict with fitting into society.

In ""Les Miserables,"" Jean Valjean's disconnect with those around him and his place in the world leads him to find a deeper purpose in aiding others to not feel unwanted. He acts as the flawed protagonist who fuels a story about love persevering through catastrophic times due to his experiences feeling out of place.

Valjean's past as a convict follows him wherever he goes, making it difficult for him to find acceptance and belonging in society. He is constantly reminded of his past mistakes and is treated as an outcast by those who know of his criminal history. This isolation and rejection from society further deepens his feelings of being out of place.

However, Valjean's experiences also shape his character and drive him to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Despite his own struggles, he takes in the orphaned Cosette and becomes a father figure to her. He dedicates his life to protecting and providing for her, ensuring that she does not experience the same feelings of being unwanted and out of place that he has endured.

Valjean's actions demonstrate the transformative power of love and compassion. Through his selfless acts, he not only changes the lives of those around him but also finds a sense of purpose and belonging himself. His past faults and experiences may have initially made him feel out of place, but they ultimately lead him to a greater understanding of the importance of acceptance and empathy.

In conclusion, our past faults and experiences can indeed make us feel out of place in the present community, culture, and world. However, as demonstrated by Jean Valjean in ""Les Miserables,"" these experiences can also serve as catalysts for personal growth and positive change. Valjean's journey from feeling isolated and unwanted to finding purpose and love highlights the resilience of the human spirit and the potential for redemption. It is through embracing our past and using it to fuel our actions that we can create a more inclusive and compassionate world for ourselves and others."
6,"Colson Whitehead's novel, ""The Underground Railroad,"" offers a unique perspective on slavery by creating an extremely relevant analogy to modern interracial conflicts. The book goes beyond merely depicting the horrors of slavery; it delves into the discrimination and marginalization faced by African Americans. Although set in the mid-19th century, the novel serves as a powerful commentary on American racial history and the African American experience as a whole.

In ""The Underground Railroad,"" the protagonist, Cora, escapes from a plantation and seeks refuge in various homes along her journey. However, she never truly feels at home in any of these places, constantly feeling the need to keep running in search of somewhere else. This perpetual sense of displacement mirrors the enduring presence of racism in America. Despite efforts to promote equality and a sense of belonging for African Americans, the struggle persists, and current circumstances often fail to provide satisfaction.

Cora's endless journey symbolizes the ongoing struggle for racial equality in America. Just as she cannot find a permanent home, African Americans continue to face discrimination and prejudice in various forms. Whitehead's novel highlights the need for constant vigilance and effort in the fight against racism. It serves as a reminder that progress is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing process that requires continuous dedication.

Moreover, ""The Underground Railroad"" emphasizes the importance of recognizing and understanding the historical context of racial discrimination. By drawing parallels between the past and the present, Whitehead prompts readers to reflect on the enduring legacy of slavery and its impact on contemporary society. The novel challenges readers to confront uncomfortable truths and confront the systemic racism that still exists.

Through Cora's journey, Whitehead also explores the complex nature of identity and belonging. Cora's constant search for a place where she can truly belong reflects the struggle faced by many African Americans in finding their place in a society that often marginalizes them. The novel underscores the need for a society that embraces diversity and provides equal opportunities for all its members.

In conclusion, Colson Whitehead's novel, ""The Underground Railroad,"" offers a profound exploration of slavery, discrimination, and the African American experience. By creating an analogy to modern interracial conflicts, the novel sheds light on the enduring presence of racism in America. Cora's endless journey serves as a reminder that efforts to promote equality and a sense of belonging for African Americans must persist, even in the face of ongoing challenges. Whitehead's work calls upon readers to confront the past, understand the present, and strive for a future where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect."
6,"In the early 1900s, during a time of new money and old money, there existed a man named Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby was a wealthy individual who had made a name for himself in the realm of new money. Although new money and old money may seem similar, they represent two completely different lifestyles. Old money refers to wealth that has been inherited over generations and passed down within families, while new money is the wealth that younger generations have created for themselves. However, despite the fact that money is money, there is something missing from Gatsby's life.

In F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, ""The Great Gatsby,"" Jay Gatsby is portrayed as a man desperately seeking help as he finds himself drowning in his own wealth. While money has always been glorified in movies and television shows, Gatsby's perspective unveils a world of suffering and sadness hidden beneath the surface. Gatsby, despite his riches, is an unhappy individual who feels out of place in his own world. His sole desire in life is to be with Daisy Buchanan, but due to the divide between new and old money, this longing will never be fulfilled."
6,"Prometheus, according to Greek mythology, was the one who gave fire, the first major technological advancement, to humans. While any of the Olympians could have theoretically granted knowledge of fire to humans, Prometheus stood out among them as the only one attached enough to humanity to see himself as deeply connected to humans. In most accounts, Prometheus is also the creator of humans, from clay. This feeling compels him to do something that he knows to be a crime, providing fire, in support of humanity. Thus, he is thought of as the forebear or progenitor of humanity, and Greek mythology views him in a positive light for this.

In ""Frankenstein"" by Mary Shelley, the protagonist Victor is driven to science by a feeling of singularity in terms of his abilities and interests. He introduces a substantially negative impact, despite the similarities between his arc and a Promethean one, because of his belief that ""might makes right"".

Prometheus and Victor share a common thread in their pursuit of knowledge and their desire to benefit humanity. However, their motivations and actions diverge greatly. Prometheus, out of his deep connection to humanity, willingly commits a crime to provide fire, a symbol of progress and enlightenment. He is driven by compassion and a genuine desire to uplift humanity.

On the other hand, Victor's pursuit of knowledge is driven by a sense of superiority and the belief that his abilities make him entitled to play God. He is not motivated by compassion or a genuine desire to benefit humanity. Instead, he is driven by his own ego and the desire for recognition and power. Victor's actions lead to disastrous consequences, as he creates a monster that wreaks havoc and destruction.

While both Prometheus and Victor can be seen as figures who challenge the boundaries of human knowledge and push the limits of what is possible, their intentions and moral compasses differ greatly. Prometheus is celebrated in Greek mythology for his selflessness and compassion, while Victor is condemned for his arrogance and disregard for the consequences of his actions.

In conclusion, the similarities between Prometheus and Victor in their pursuit of knowledge and their impact on humanity are evident. However, their motivations and the moral implications of their actions set them apart. Prometheus is viewed positively in Greek mythology for his selfless act of providing fire to humans, while Victor's actions in ""Frankenstein"" are seen as negative due to his belief in ""might makes right"". The contrasting outcomes of their actions highlight the importance of intention and compassion in the pursuit of knowledge and progress."
6,"The Regency period in England was a strange intermediary time in England. The days before the French and American revolutions were gone, but the business of the Victorian era had not yet arrived. As a result, many people felt out of place in their society as it restructured around them, as the middle class truly formed. This idea directly affects Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, as she feels out of place in society. This placelessness is ultimately resolved by her elevation in society when she marries Mr. Darcy. This feeling of not belonging and its resolution aid in creating the female Regency fantasy that Jane Austen captures. By describing how Elizabeth feels out of place, Jane Austen is able to express that what Elizabeth truly desires is the sense of belonging she later finds with Mr. Darcy, allowing her to express to the reader that acceptance in love is one of the deepest human desires."
6,"In Never Let Me Go, written by Kazuo Ishiguro, the entire premise of the protagonist Kathy's life is being out of place in this world. Set in a dystopian setting where humans, or ""possibles,"" can be cloned, the sole purpose of the existence of these clones is to supply organs when the originals fall ill. Kathy and her classmates are devalued, dehumanized, and out of place in this world as they are the clones. Ishiguro creates an ominous atmosphere as Kathy slowly begins to realize how she is an outsider, though she never fully realizes how wrong it is for her to ""complete"" and society to take her life, as she fully functions as a human being with a soul. Ultimately, Ishiguro uses Kathy's experience of feeling out of place to convey his deeper message that the fundamental human fear is to not be of value. The novel depicts her process of developing multiple coping mechanisms to her reality of being just a clone in this world.

Throughout the novel, Kathy's sense of being out of place is evident. From the very beginning, she describes herself and her classmates as ""different"" and ""special."" They are constantly reminded of their purpose and their lack of true identity. They are not allowed to have dreams or aspirations beyond their role as organ donors. This dehumanization is a constant reminder of their lack of value in society. Ishiguro's use of language and imagery further emphasizes this sense of being out of place. The clones are often described as ""copies"" or ""replicas,"" highlighting their lack of individuality and uniqueness. They are seen as objects, rather than human beings with emotions and desires.

As Kathy grows older, she begins to question her place in the world. She starts to wonder if there is more to life than just being a donor. She forms relationships with her classmates and experiences love and loss. These experiences further highlight her humanity and her desire to be valued. However, she never fully realizes the extent of her devaluation. She accepts her fate and continues to fulfill her role as a donor. This acceptance is a coping mechanism, a way for Kathy to survive in a world that sees her as disposable.

Ishiguro's deeper message in Never Let Me Go is that the fundamental human fear is to not be of value. Kathy's experience of feeling out of place is a reflection of this fear. She longs to be seen as more than just a clone, to be valued for who she is as a person. This fear is universal and resonates with readers, as we all desire to be seen and valued for our individuality. Ishiguro's portrayal of Kathy's coping mechanisms also highlights the lengths we will go to in order to feel valued. Kathy's acceptance of her fate and her willingness to sacrifice herself for others is a testament to the power of this fear.

In conclusion, Never Let Me Go explores the theme of feeling out of place and the fear of not being of value. Kathy's experience as a clone in a dystopian society highlights the dehumanization and devaluation of individuals. Ishiguro's use of language and imagery creates an ominous atmosphere, emphasizing the sense of being out of place. Through Kathy's journey, Ishiguro conveys the deeper message that the fundamental human fear is to not be of value. The novel serves as a reminder of the importance of recognizing and valuing the humanity in others."
6,"The experience of feeling out of place is an alienating one. This feeling can cause resentment, anger, and frustration in a character and is often released on the person or people that caused them the feeling of alienation in the first place. This theme of alienation is seen clearly in John Garner's novel ""Grendel"". Throughout the novel, the main character Grendel revels in his inability to communicate with the people around him due to their fear of him, and throughout the beginning of the novel, he searches for acceptance and guidance.

When Grendel is met with nothing but violence from the people of the Kingdom, he becomes violent himself and seeks revenge on the people of the town. Throughout the novel, Grendel's continued alienation from his mother and the humans makes him confused and angry. When his search for acceptance only makes him more confused, he turns to violence as a way of interacting with the humans in the kingdom.

Grendel's alienation is evident from the very beginning of the novel. He is portrayed as a monster, feared and despised by the humans. This fear and hatred prevent any meaningful communication between Grendel and the people around him. Grendel longs for acceptance and tries to understand the humans, but his efforts are met with violence and rejection.

As the novel progresses, Grendel's alienation intensifies. He is unable to connect with his mother, who is distant and unresponsive. This lack of connection leaves Grendel feeling isolated and confused. He seeks guidance from the dragon, hoping to find answers and a sense of purpose. However, the dragon only further alienates Grendel, filling his mind with nihilistic ideas and encouraging his violent tendencies.

Grendel's frustration and anger reach a boiling point when he witnesses the humans celebrating their victories and achievements. He becomes resentful of their happiness and success, feeling excluded and left out. This resentment fuels his desire for revenge, and he begins attacking the humans, causing chaos and destruction.

In his violent interactions with the humans, Grendel finds a twisted form of connection. Through his acts of violence, he is able to elicit fear and attention from the humans, albeit negative attention. This violent interaction becomes his way of communicating with the humans, as he is unable to find any other means of connection.

The theme of alienation in ""Grendel"" serves as a commentary on the destructive nature of exclusion and the consequences it can have on an individual. Grendel's alienation leads him down a path of violence and destruction, as he seeks revenge on those who have rejected him. The novel serves as a reminder of the importance of acceptance and understanding, and the dangers of pushing others away.

In conclusion, the experience of feeling out of place can be a deeply alienating one. This feeling of alienation can lead to resentment, anger, and frustration, as seen in John Garner's novel ""Grendel"". Grendel's inability to communicate with the people around him and his continued alienation from his mother and the humans drive him to violence as a means of interaction. The novel serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the destructive consequences of exclusion and the importance of acceptance and understanding."
6,"In ""The House on Mango Street"", the main character grows up as a child of first-generation immigrants to the United States struggling to keep a large family afloat with only two sources of income. She is one of the younger siblings, and in addition to her older siblings splitting off into cliques of their own, she lacks respect from all due to her naivete. The combination of these experiences alienates the main character from her family and then once more from the friends she surrounds herself with. Moreover, in a neighborhood of scattered ethnic identities which prioritizes whiteness and conformity, the family is further alienated from their culture and their language. The lack of attachment the main character experiences throughout ""The House on Mango Street"" influences her experience growing up and how the reader experiences sexism, racism, and prejudice alongside the main character as her story progresses."
